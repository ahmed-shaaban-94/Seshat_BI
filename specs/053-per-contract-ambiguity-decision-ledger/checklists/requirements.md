# Specification Quality Checklist: Per-Contract Ambiguity Decision Ledger

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Two [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain intentionally (FR-013 headline-moving
  criterion, FR-014 roadmap placement). These are Principle-V human judgment calls
  deliberately reserved for a named owner and recorded in the Clarifications section.
  They are NOT to be answered by the agent; they do not block the DEFINE-layer
  authoring scope of this feature.
