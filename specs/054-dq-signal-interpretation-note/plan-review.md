# Adversarial Plan-Review: DQ-Signal Interpretation Note

**Feature**: `053-dq-signal-interpretation-note-1` | **Date**: 2026-07-01
**Reviewer posture**: single default-adverse skeptic, READ-ONLY (reports fixes, edits
nothing). Artifacts reviewed: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, research.md,
contracts/template-contract.md, analysis.md.

Gate precheck: analyze ran (analysis.md present, verdict CLEAN) and tasks.md exists ->
not an automatic BLOCKED.

## Axis 1 -- hidden-principle-violation

- Checked whether any artifact auto-decides a Principle-V call. The KPI+direction
  mapping (FR-003, T003), PII publish-safety (FR-007, T008), direction-of-distortion
  correctness claim (FR-011, T004), and stage-of-record/roadmap (FR-010) are ALL
  presented as owner-gated fill-ins or left OPEN in spec ## Clarifications. The
  direction-semantics note (contract #3) is framed as "the analyst's ruling to state",
  not asserted by the template. NO hidden violation.
- Verdict: PASS.

## Axis 2 -- assumes-deferred-capability

- Checked for reliance on F016 (Power BI execution adapter) or a live validate run as
  if present. Plan Technical Context marks F016 verified absent and not referenced as a
  consumer; spec Assumptions marks the live validate run deferred and states the
  template is authorable now with its filled value gated on that run (a table with no
  run has no content). No artifact assumes a tooling-emitted `-1` tally -- all point to
  the hand-filled data-issues.md row. NO deferred-capability assumption.
- Verdict: PASS.

## Axis 3 -- c086-leak

- The idea title itself is C086-derived ("-1 unknown-member ... business caveat"), so
  this axis is the highest residual risk. The GENERIC deliverable
  (`templates/handoff/dq-signal-interpretation.md`, built in Phase 2-4) is constrained
  by FR-001/FR-008, contract MUST-NOT, and a T011(a) grep (`salesperson`, `ezaby`,
  `\b71\b`, fixed measure) to carry zero pharmacy/C086 specifics; C086 is cited only by
  reference (T009). The spec/plan/research legitimately name "salesperson"/"71" only to
  DISTINGUISH the filled instance from the generic template -- the same discipline the
  shipped `reconciliation-report.md` header uses. NO leak into the generic artifact as
  planned.
- NOTE (low): the builder MUST run the T011(a) grep against the generic template ONLY
  (not the spec dir) and keep it at zero hits; the C086-shaped title makes an accidental
  inline the most likely defect at build time.
- Verdict: PASS-WITH-NOTE.

## Axis 4 -- fabricated-confidence

- Checked for any new/re-measured number or numeric confidence/health/readiness score.
  FR-002 forbids a new number (count by reference only); FR-004 + T005 give an explicit
  "none recorded -> zero caveats" path so an empty note is never invented; FR-009 +
  contract MUST-NOT forbid any confidence score. NO fabricated confidence.
- Verdict: PASS.

## Axis 5 -- over-scope

- Checked against "add the seam, not the implementation" (YAGNI). Deliverable = ONE new
  template + additive cross-reference wiring. No executor, rule, validator, query, or
  dependency (tasks Out-of-scope + plan Constitution Check). Scoped to the `-1` signal
  only, not a general DQ-signal interpreter (spec Q1). The one scope-creep vector is
  T010's edit to shipped docs (`bi-handoff-pack.md`, `publish-ready.md`).
- NOTE (low): T010 must stay a strictly ADDITIVE one-line cross-reference -- no change
  to any existing required-section, count, gate wording, or behavior. If a clean
  additive insertion is not possible, defer the wiring rather than restructure a shipped
  template.
- Verdict: PASS-WITH-NOTE.

## Overall verdict

**Verdict**: PASS-WITH-NOTES

PASS-WITH-NOTES. All six stages present (specify, clarify, plan, tasks, analyze,
plan-review); analyze CLEAN (0 critical / 0 high). Two low, build-time NOTES for the
implementer:
  1. Keep the generic template grep-clean of C086/pharmacy tokens (the C086-shaped
     title is the leak risk); grep the template only.
  2. Keep T010's wiring edits to shipped docs strictly additive.
Two Principle-V items stay OPEN for the human ratifier (FR-010 stage-of-record /
F-number; FR-011 direction-of-distortion correctness claim) plus PII publish-safety and
KPI-mapping ownership -- these are ratify-time human calls, not build blockers.

The spec front-matter Status stays "Draft" (ratification is a human edit this review is
forbidden to make).
