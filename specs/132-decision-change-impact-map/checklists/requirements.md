# Specification Quality Checklist: Decision Change Impact Map

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- **Validation performed 2026-07-15 (iteration 1):**
  - *No implementation details in FR/SC/user stories*: verified. The reuse-vs-new table, Drift-Found section, and Assumptions deliberately name existing authorities (module paths, spec numbers, capability ids) — this is permitted because those sections document *what is reused*, not *how the feature is built*. HOW-level detail (promoting a private helper, adopting a specific node_id vocabulary, extending a globber) is deferred to plan.md and does NOT appear in any FR-*, NFR-*, SC-*, or acceptance scenario. Re-checked FR-001..FR-025, NFR-001..NFR-006, SC-001..SC-013: all behavioral.
  - *No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers*: verified — zero markers. The single interpretive gap ("preserve supersession history" against a pointer-only substrate) is resolved as clarification D2 + FR-006 + an explicit Assumption, not left as a marker.
  - *Testable/unambiguous requirements*: each FR states a MUST with an observable condition; each maps to at least one acceptance scenario and/or SC.
  - *Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria*: SC-001..SC-013 are verifiable by fixture runs / structural scans / byte diffs without naming a language or framework (SC-005 mirrors spec 124's SC-003 digit-then-`%` structural test).
  - *Acceptance scenarios + edge cases*: every user story carries Given/When/Then scenarios; the Edge Cases section enumerates the fixture-demanded cases (direct/transitive, cycles, stale evidence, missing refs, conflicts, incomplete lineage, dangling pointer).
  - *Scope bounded*: Non-Goals + the no-duplicate table + FR-001/FR-024/FR-025 bound the boundary; MVP = US1+US2.
  - *Dependencies/assumptions*: the reuse-vs-new table, Assumptions, and Drift-Found sections record every reused authority and every interpretive default.
- **Result: all items pass on iteration 1. Spec is ready for `/speckit-clarify`.**
- **`/speckit.analyze` cross-artifact pass (2026-07-15):** an independent adversarial reviewer + a
  systematic coverage map found **0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH**; 47/47 requirements (FR-001..025, NFR-001..006,
  SEC-001..003, SC-001..013) have id-cited task coverage. Remediation applied inside the feature dir
  only (no requirement weakened): reconciled the no-score forbidden-key set to 8 keys incl. `trust`
  across spec/data-model/contract/tasks; added `contributing_decisions[]` to `affected[]`
  (data-model + contract + T011); added the `non_approved_subject/` fixture + test T010a for the
  approved-only precondition; added T041 as the actual SC-012/NFR-005 no-leak scan (distinct from the
  T002 fixture constraint); added explicit id citations closing all traceability gaps; documented the
  `_evidence_stale` promotion-asymmetry rationale in research.md + plan.md; bounded affected-stage
  placement in the contract. Re-verification confirmed every finding RESOLVED with no CRITICAL/HIGH
  remaining and no new inconsistency. Analysis converged.
