# Specification Quality Checklist: Adapter Maintenance and Auto-Update Policy

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) (F031, spec directory 025)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) -- the policy is stated
      in lanes + required checks + invariants, not code
- [x] Focused on user/maintainer value and the Principle-II safe-upgrade need
- [x] Written for a maintainer + a reviewer (non-implementation stakeholders)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (purpose, actors, user stories, acceptance,
      non-goals, dependencies, readiness stage, allowed/forbidden ops, evidence,
      human approval boundary, implementation boundaries)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (open decisions recorded as deferred,
      not blockers)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (each FR maps to an acceptance scenario)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (SC-001..SC-005 are checkable assertions)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where possible (concrete package names
      appear only as lane-membership examples)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (US1 lane classification; US2 required
      checks; US3 compatibility review)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (transitive escalation, unavailable check, gate-behavior
      change, secret/path leak, red CI, force-merge attempt)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (the scope wall: no doc/CI/code this slice; automerge
      below the spine; generic; no fake confidence)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (F024 category; F029/F030/F016 governed;
      F032 paired; existing CI + gates as runtimes)

## Requirement-Specific Acceptance (this feature)

- [x] Exactly three lanes are defined and each example package class in FR-001 maps to
      exactly one (lane table is total -- SC-002)
- [x] Lane A is the ONLY automerge-eligible lane, and only on all-green required checks
      (FR-003)
- [x] Lane B requires a named human review; Lane C never automerges (FR-001, FR-003)
- [x] The required-checks list is exact and each item is either already in
      `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or marked "once that adapter exists / if available"
      (FR-004, FR-009, SC-003)
- [x] The transitive-escalation rule is stated: highest blast radius wins; a Lane A
      label never shields a Lane B/C effect (FR-008)
- [x] A major-version / adapter update triggers an explicit compatibility review whose
      durable record lives in F032 (FR-007)
- [x] The no-secrets / no-paths check is a hard merge blocker in every lane (FR-006)
- [x] No dependency/adapter health/maturity/confidence score is emitted; status is
      explicit checks + lane + reviewer (FR-010, SC-005)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements (FR-001..FR-012) have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover the primary flows (classify -> check -> compatibility review)
- [x] Feature meets the measurable outcomes in Success Criteria (SC-001..SC-005)
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification (the policy is the artifact;
      the bot config / docs / ADR are enumerated futures, not built here)
- [x] The readiness-stage-affected answer is explicit: none directly; protects all
      stages from update drift

## Notes

- This is a docs/planning-only slice (Principle VIII, roadmap rule #8): it adds no
  runtime code and no CI config, so "implementation details" here means the lane/check
  field shapes, which are the planning artifact -- not application code.
- The apparent tension between automerge and "no tool self-approves" (Principle V) is
  resolved IN the spec: automerge lives below the readiness spine and may never move a
  stage to `pass` or clear a blocker. The governance checklist verifies this resolution.
- The future deliverables (`docs/operations/dependency-update-policy.md`,
  `docs/operations/adapter-update-policy.md`,
  `docs/decisions/0011-safe-auto-updates.md`, optional
  `.github/dependabot.yml` / `renovate.json`) are ENUMERATED in plan.md and tasks.md as
  planned outputs; none is created in this slice.
- The compatibility-review verdict and the Lane B/C approvals are deliberately
  surfaced as named-human decisions (Principle V), not auto-answered in the spec.
