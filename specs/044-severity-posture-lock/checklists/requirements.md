# Specification Quality Checklist: Severity-Posture Regression Lock

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: (date pending -- operator to fill)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Two [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in FR-009 (grain/uniqueness) and
  FR-010 (L3 coverage scope). These are DELIBERATE Principle-V carve-outs:
  load-bearing human design rulings that the planning agent is forbidden to
  answer. They are recorded in the spec's ## Clarifications block for human
  resolution and are NOT defects to be auto-resolved before planning.
- The "No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain" item stays unchecked by design;
  it is gated on human ratification, not on the planning workflow.
- Items marked incomplete here are intentional and tracked; they do not block
  /speckit-clarify or /speckit-plan from running on the resolvable portion.
- Clarify session (date pending) resolved 3 non-judgment ambiguities (artifact
  format/location, comparison method, no-finding marker -> FR-011/FR-012) and
  REFUSED 4 Principle-V judgment calls (grain, L3 coverage, readiness mapping,
  update protocol), which remain in ## Clarifications for human resolution.
