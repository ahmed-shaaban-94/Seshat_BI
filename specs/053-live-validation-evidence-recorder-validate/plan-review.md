# Adversarial Plan-Review: 053 Live-validation evidence recorder

**Date**: 2026-07-01 | **Reviewer stance**: single default-adverse skeptic
**Scope**: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, analysis.md (READ-ONLY -- fixes proposed, not applied)
**Precondition check**: spec + plan + tasks + analysis all present -> not auto-BLOCKED.

## Axis 1 -- hidden-principle-violation

Probed whether the recorder self-grants a readiness pass or weakens a gate.
- The recorder never sets status:pass (FR-012 default; enforced by T002/T016).
- Deferred mode is recorded as blocked, never inferred to pass (FR-011, VIII).
- No numeric confidence anywhere (FR-005, IX).
- DSN/credential redaction preserved end-to-end (FR-006, IX/C2).
- Subtle probe: does writing an evidence[] entry for a clean run itself grant
  the stage? No -- gold-ready.md separates "evidence recorded" from the terminal
  pass; recording evidence is not the authoritative claim. The pass-set authority
  is correctly left OPEN (FR-012).
Verdict: no hidden violation. The three genuine Principle V judgments
(pass-set, write-vs-emit, grain-claim) are left as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] and
routed to a human, not self-answered.

## Axis 2 -- assumes-deferred-capability

Checked for reliance on unbuilt capability.
- Plan Technical Context adds NO new dependency; consumes only shipped seams
  (Finding/to_dict from B2, run_live_checks, _redact_dsn) -- all confirmed
  present in the repo during analyze.
- tasks Out-of-scope explicitly disclaims F016 (Power BI Execution Adapter) and
  F031-F033. No task depends on them.
Verdict: clean. No deferred capability assumed.

## Axis 3 -- c086-leak

Checked for worked-example (pharmacy) specifics leaking into generic artifacts.
- FR-009 forbids hardcoded C086/table/column/measure names; FR-010 forbids
  writing findings into the generic template; T014 greps for such literals; T015
  confirms no write to templates/readiness-status.yaml.
- Table identifiers appear only via run inputs and only in a table-specific
  filled copy -- correct per ADR 0004 and Principle VII.
Verdict: clean. Guardrails are explicit and testable.

## Axis 4 -- fabricated-confidence

Checked for invented certainty / scores / dishonest analyze.
- FR-005 + T016 forbid any numeric confidence/score field.
- The analysis.md verdict is honest: it reports 0 critical / 0 high and only
  3 low/info notes; it does not overclaim coverage and explicitly marks the
  three deferred items as deferred-by-design rather than covered.
Verdict: clean. No fabricated confidence.

## Axis 5 -- over-scope

Checked for scope creep beyond the seam.
- The file writer (FR-013) and pass-setting (FR-012) are DEFERRED behind human
  rulings and appear only in an explicit Out-of-scope list, not as tasks.
- The delivered scope is one pure module + unit tests + guardrail checks; no CLI
  behavior change is forced (the wiring seam is optional / emit-only default).
- No DB provisioning, ingestion, or orchestrator wiring (CLAUDE.md YAGNI).
Verdict: clean. Scope is the seam, not the implementation.

## Notes / residual risk

- A1 (analyze): the clean-run block intentionally leaves status un-passed while
  evidence[] is populated. This is correct under FR-012 but is a legibility risk
  for a downstream reader/skill that expects status to move. Not a blocker; the
  emitted block should carry a note that the terminal pass is a human action.
  I am confident this is NOT a critical issue.
- The three Principle V opens (FR-012/013/014) MUST be ruled on by a human before
  any implement run touches pass-setting or file-writing; the spec is safe to
  ratify with them open because the buildable seam (emit-only, never pass) is
  fully specified independent of those rulings.

## Verdict

No critical or high finding on any axis. Two low/legibility notes carried into
the record, both non-blocking. All required artifacts present.
