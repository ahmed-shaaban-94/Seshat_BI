# Contract: Ambiguity Ledger Block (`ambiguities[]`)

The field contract for the net-new top-level `ambiguities` block on
`templates/metric-contract.yaml`. This is an authoring contract (schema + invariants a
reviewer applies), NOT a runtime schema validated by code -- there is no check rule in scope.

## Shape

```yaml
# top-level block on a metric contract, SIBLING of `readiness` (not nested in it).
ambiguities:                          # zero or more entries; only APPLICABLE ambiguities
  - id: "A7"                          # A1..A11 ONLY (A10 inventory snapshot, A11 same-store)
    decision_status: "undecided"      # decided | undecided ONLY -- no third word (rule #9)
    ruling: ""                        # plain-language INTENT once decided; never DAX/SQL/model path
    evidence: []                      # owner+date once decided: ["ruled by <owner> on <YYYY-MM-DD>"]
    number_moving: true               # true if the candidate rulings change a reported number
  - id: "A4"
    decision_status: "decided"
    ruling: "Discount rate denominator counts known-status transactions only (excludes cancelled/void/blank)."
    evidence: ["ruled by <metric owner> on <YYYY-MM-DD>"]
    number_moving: true
```

## Field rules

- `id` -- REQUIRED. String matching one of A1, A2, ..., A11. Any other value is a defect.
  The full A1..A11 range is in play; narrowing to A1..A10 (dropping A11 same-store) is a
  defect (SC-005).
- `decision_status` -- REQUIRED. Exactly one of `decided` | `undecided` (the ruled vocabulary,
  spec ## Clarifications). No third word and no numeric certainty may be invented (rule #9).
- `ruling` -- REQUIRED when `decision_status: decided`. Plain-language business INTENT only.
  A DAX expression, SQL, a visual/page spec, or a `powerbi/` path is REJECTED (define/check
  boundary, FR-003).
- `evidence` -- REQUIRED (non-empty) when `decision_status: decided`. Records the owner-and-date
  and any committed support. A decided entry with empty evidence is a defect (mirrors the
  readiness `pass` rule).
- `number_moving` -- REQUIRED boolean. `true` if the candidate rulings would change a reported
  number for this contract. Per FR-013 (fail-safe), a `number_moving: true` + `undecided`
  entry forces the contract's `readiness.status: blocked`; a named owner may record
  `number_moving: false` to make it non-blocking, but the agent never downgrades it.

## Cross-field / cross-artifact invariants

1. **Blocker propagation (FR-004/FR-013)**: an entry with `decision_status: undecided` AND
   `number_moving: true` records a `blocking_reason` on the contract's `readiness` (naming the
   ambiguity) and forces `readiness.status: blocked`. The agent may recommend but never
   self-grants a `decided` status; only a recorded owner ruling clears it.
2. **No fake confidence (FR-005)**: no `confidence` / `score` / numeric-certainty field on any
   entry.
3. **Applicability (FR-015/FR-016)**: only applicable ambiguities are recorded; non-applicable
   ones are omitted (optionally with a one-line note), never marked with a decided status.
   Omission of an applicable material ambiguity is a review defect (treated as undecided).
4. **Sibling placement (FR-017)**: the block is a top-level sibling of `readiness`, never
   nested inside it; the readiness block's verbatim shape does not drift.
5. **Define/check boundary (FR-008/FR-010)**: no field carries implementation or a check; the
   ledger is INTENT + ruling + evidence, honored by a human reviewer, not a program.
6. **Generic-retail only (FR-007/FR-012)**: the template block uses generic placeholders and
   the generic discounted-transaction-rate motivating case; no domain-specific ruling is
   inlined -- real rulings are cited via the worked example.
7. **Encoding (FR-011)**: ASCII + UTF-8 no BOM; `--` and `->` not glyphs; short paths.

## Reviewer acceptance (maps to spec scenarios)

- US1: a decided entry reads end-to-end (id + status + ruling + evidence) with no numeric
  confidence.
- US2: an undecided material entry carries a blocking reason and the contract is `blocked`,
  with no author path to `pass` without a recorded owner ruling.
- US3: a pack whose member is blocked is no more ready than that member, via the existing
  rollup rule, with no new rollup logic present.
