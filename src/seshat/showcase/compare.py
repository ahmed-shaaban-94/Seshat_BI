"""Optional before/after comparison over two Passport snapshots (US4).

Two Passport snapshots are comparable only when they share ``schema_version``
and ``scope`` and differ in ``source_revision`` (R5). When comparable, the
stage transitions and evidence verdicts are computed by diffing the two
snapshots' OWN recorded content directly (never the live workspace) and are
expressed in the Passport verify vocabulary (``verified``/``changed``/
``unavailable``) reused from ``seshat.passport``. Evidence verdicts
deliberately do NOT call ``seshat.passport.verify_passport`` -- that function
checks ONE passport's claims against the CURRENT live workspace, which would
only tell us whether ``after`` is still valid right now, not what changed
between ``before`` and ``after``. When not comparable -- different scope,
different schema, only one snapshot, or none -- the result carries
``comparable: False`` and a truthful ``omitted_reason``; no delta is ever
fabricated (FR-020/FR-021, INV-5). Read-only: no snapshot or workspace file
is written.
