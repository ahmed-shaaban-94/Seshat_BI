"""Dagster run evidence: raw records and run finalization.

ONE implementation for both environments (research D3/D4): the orchestration
package's assets append records through :class:`EvidenceWriter`; the parent
``seshat dagster`` CLI finalizes a run and renders the committed markdown --
neither side imports dagster here (stdlib + PyYAML only). Validation and
rendering live in :mod:`.evidence_render` and are re-exported here so the
public import path is stable.

DERIVED EVIDENCE ONLY: outcomes are execution words, never the readiness token
``pass``; no numeric score key is accepted anywhere (hard rule #9); every
string passes redaction before it is written (Principle IX).
