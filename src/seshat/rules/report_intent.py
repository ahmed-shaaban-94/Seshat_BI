"""Design-lint rule DL9: Report Intent well-formedness gate (spec 123, US1).

A verify-slot-only completeness gate. DL9 scans FILLED Report Intent instances
(``**/design/report-intent.yaml``, excluding the generic
``templates/report-intent.yaml`` blank and committed test fixtures) and asserts
each required field is PRESENT and non-placeholder, so downstream consumers
(the coordinator, the semantic audit) can trust the artifact's SHAPE before
reading its content.

DISTINCT FROM the coordinator's runtime checks (FR-003/FR-007, US2). DL9 never
resolves a ``*_metrics[].name`` reference against the metric-contract store --
that is a runtime state check the coordinator owns, not a static shape rule
(data-model.md D5: "do NOT add a static rule for ... metric-name resolution").
DL9 also never checks FR-002a blueprint<->intent traceability (that is US5's
categorical audit, not a pass/fail gate).

Required fields (structural presence-only, NEVER content-judged):
``audience``, ``supported_decision``, ``review_cadence`` non-empty; ``purpose``
one of the five FR-002 enum values; at least one ``business_questions`` entry
with a non-empty ``text`` (US1 AC#4); ``owner`` a well-formed
"Person Name (class_token)" shape; ``readiness.status: pass`` never recorded
with an empty ``evidence[]``.

Mirrors DL4's (``design_review_evidence.py``) discipline exactly: presence-only,
never content-judged, grants no approval, writes nothing. Reads YAML the way
DL6 (``design_visual_selfcheck.py``) does -- ``yaml.safe_load``, lazy import to
keep the retail-check core stdlib-only at module scope (B1/B3).

Pure static markdown/YAML read: no execution, no DB, no Power BI, no approval
grant. Generic: field names only, no tenant/brand literal (Principle VII).
