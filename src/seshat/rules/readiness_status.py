"""RS1 -- readiness-status contradiction linter.

The readiness spine is useful only if its recorded state is internally
consistent. RS1 checks filled per-table readiness status files
(``mappings/<table>/readiness-status.yaml``) for structural contradictions:

* every stage status is one of the four readiness words;
* ``pass`` carries evidence;
* ``blocked`` carries blocking reasons;
* non-blocked stages do not carry ``blocking_reasons[]``;
* approval-required stages cannot pass without a matching ``approvals[]`` entry;
* a FILE source (``source_ready`` block declaring ``source_kind: csv|excel``) cannot
  pass without a recorded ``source_ready`` approval -- the encoding/delimiter/header
  the mechanical numbers rest on is a ``[PROPOSED]`` inference (a wrong encoding
  silently corrupts every text column), so an owner must confirm it, exactly like the
  semantic-proposal gates. A DB source (no ``source_kind``) is unaffected;
* ``current_stage`` cannot point past an earlier blocked stage;
* a blocked current stage mirrors blockers at the top level.

It is a static text/YAML read. It never opens a DB, never runs Power BI, never
grants an approval, and never advances a stage.
