"""Hardened, read-only git state probes shared by governance gates (#334).

Governance artifacts (the unresolved-questions mirror, readiness status) are
only audit records once COMMITTED: a worktree-only edit can disappear on
checkout or revert, leaving an unaudited clearance behind. These probes let a
gate verify that the artifact it is about to trust is tracked and clean, and
read the committed (HEAD) content instead of the worktree. All probes fail
CLOSED: no git, not a repository, untracked, or dirty all read as
not-committed. The git invocation is hardened the same way as
``seshat.dbt.gate`` (no fsmonitor, no hooks, no ext protocol).
