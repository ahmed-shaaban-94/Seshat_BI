"""Content-safety and readiness-gap scanning over discovered project files.

Distinct from structural discovery: these helpers read file *contents* to raise
governance facts (credential-like literals, non-gold sources) and to record
which committed readiness artifacts are missing.  Every fact carries fixed
prose only -- the offending literal is detected, never echoed.
