"""Materialize the three Stage-1 blank templates into any workspace (#339).

The first governed action (Source Ready / Stage 1) requires a
template-conformant ``source-profile.md`` plus a ``readiness-status.yaml`` and
``source-map.yaml``. Those blank templates previously shipped only with the
development repository, so a bare ``pip install seshat-bi`` left a new user
with nothing to copy -- violating the portable operating contract's "Never
require the Seshat development repository for normal use".

``scaffold_source`` closes that gap by writing the three blanks into
``mappings/<table>/`` from bundled package data (wheel force-include; a
development checkout falls back to the repo ``templates/`` dir, mirroring
``seshat.governed_projects``). Only table-neutral blank templates ship
(constitution VII). Writes are per-file non-destructive: an existing file is
always kept, never overwritten. Pure stdlib -- no DB, no network.
