"""Friendly PR Reviewer -- plain-language PR summary (spec 130).

A PRESENTATION layer over ALREADY-SHIPPED, ALREADY-AUTHORITATIVE governance
results. This module creates no truth: it renders, in plain language, what the
shipped engines already decided. It is explicitly DISTINCT from the shipped
``pr-readiness-reviewer`` skill (F025, ``.claude/skills/pr-readiness-reviewer/``),
which owns the merge-safety VERDICT (a ``merge_ready`` boolean). This module
never renders a ``merge_ready`` boolean and never duplicates that verdict
surface -- it only explains what changed and what it means.

Consumed seams (read by field, never re-derived, never mutated):
  - ``review_integration.build_review_result`` -- the review envelope:
    ``outcome`` (only ever ``"ok"`` or ``"blocked"`` -- there is no
    ``input_defect`` outcome value; an absent/unproducible envelope is a
    separate honesty branch, handled here as ``envelope is None``),
    ``checks_run``, ``changed_files``, ``changed_readiness_state``,
    ``affected_stages``, ``findings[]``, ``blocking_findings[]``,
    ``next_actions[]``, ``run_boundary``, ``result_digest``.
  - ``sarif.finding_fingerprint`` -- sha256(rule_id + severity + locator +
    message); the canonical new-vs-existing identity key. ``classify_changes``
    calls this function directly rather than reimplementing the hash.
  - ``readiness_classify.classify`` / ``rank_of`` / ``CATEGORY_RANK`` -- the
    refutation-first category rank (approval > grain > live_validation >
    artifact > readiness), reused BOTH to pick exactly one next action
    (``pick_next_action``) and to route a blocked stage to its required
    authority/surface (``render_summary``'s authority lookup).
  - ``readiness_evidence._scrub`` -- read for context only, NOT lifted. It
    redacts a DSN only when the caller already holds the literal DSN string
    (a shape it does not detect); this module has no DSN, so a bare
    DSN/connection-string URL in a finding message is NOT masked here (a
    documented v1 non-coverage -- see ``mask()``).
  - ``interview_review._mask`` -- the PRIVATE PII/secret masker is NOT
    imported. Its four detectable SHAPES (email, SSN/national-ID-like number,
    long digit run, ``key: value`` secret assignment) are reproduced here as a
    new, self-contained, public, testable ``mask()`` function (same shapes,
    same replacement token, cited below) -- this is not a new redaction
    engine, it is the same shapes lifted into a public function.
  - ``readiness-status.yaml`` shape (``current_stage``, per-stage ``status``,
    ``approvals[]``, ``blocking_reasons[]``) -- read as an already-parsed
    mapping (this module does no YAML I/O itself; a caller loads the file).

Invariants (Principle VIII; B1/B3 import-boundary guards):
  - Read-only: no file writes, no readiness-stage moves, no approvals granted.
  - No network: no HTTP, no GitHub API call, no DB connection.
  - No clock: no ``datetime.now()`` / ``time.time()`` read anywhere in this
    module; a timestamp is always an explicit caller-supplied argument.
  - No score: no numeric merge/confidence/health/maturity/completeness score
    or percentage anywhere. Every status is a verbatim categorical token.
  - stdlib-only: this module imports only the Python standard library plus
    sibling in-repo modules (``.core``, ``.sarif``, ``.readiness_classify``)
    that are themselves stdlib-only. No ``yaml``, no ``requests``, no ``gh``.
