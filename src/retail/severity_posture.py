"""Severity-posture observation harness + golden-record generator (feature 044).

Severity is NOT a property of a registered rule: the registry entry carries an
id and a title and no severity field, and a single rule id can emit findings in
more than one severity class depending on which violation branch fires (the
shipped SQL guard-form rule ``S4b`` emits both ERROR and WARNING). Therefore the
golden record CANNOT be read from the registry as a flat id->class map -- it is
OBSERVED by forcing each rule to fire over planted, synthetic, minimal input and
recording the set of severity classes it emits.

Record GRAIN (FR-009, advisor-resolved option (a)):
    ``rule_id -> the SORTED SET of severity classes that rule emits when forced``
A multi-class rule records the FULL set (e.g. ``["error", "warning"]``); it is
NEVER collapsed to one class. A rule that genuinely cannot be forced to fire over
a minimal synthetic fixture records an EXPLICIT no-finding marker (FR-011), never
a silent omission.

Record COVERAGE (FR-010, advisor-resolved): TWO explicitly-named sections --
  * ``registered``: one entry per registry-reachable rule (``all_rules()``);
  * ``L3:verdict_to_finding``: the non-registered L3 governance surface
    (``semantic.verdict_to_finding``: drift -> ERROR / escalate -> WARNING),
    observed in-process by driving a frozen ``Verdict`` value -- no YAML/DB/model/
    agent, so the static-first invariant (Principle VIII) holds. The L3 entry adds
    NO ``@register`` and NO new expected-rule-id (ADR-0007); the registry-reachable
    rule count is unchanged.

Deterministic serialization contract (Principle IX -- cross-platform stable):
  * the top-level object has exactly two keys: ``registered`` and ``l3``;
  * ``registered`` maps each ``rule_id`` to its severity entry; ``l3`` maps the
    single key ``L3:verdict_to_finding`` to its severity entry;
  * each severity entry is the SORTED list of severity string values
    (``"error"`` < ``"info"`` < ``"warning"`` by string value), or the explicit
    no-finding marker list ``["<no-finding>"]`` (FR-011);
  * ``json.dumps(indent=2, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=True)`` so key order is
    stable regardless of insertion order; a single trailing ``\\n``; UTF-8 without
    BOM; ``newline="\\n"`` on write keeps the bytes identical on Windows under
    ``core.autocrlf=true``.

This module adds NO new registered rule and NO new ``EXPECTED_RULE_ID``: it is a
generator + a test-only golden assertion, never a ``retail check`` rule.
