"""SL1 -- coverage-scorecard linter.

A committed per-table KPI coverage scorecard
(``mappings/<table>/<...>coverage-scorecard.md``) is the F8 artifact that answers, for
one source table, which KPIs can be served today -- as an explicit **status + named
blocker**, never a number (hard rule #9). Today nothing structurally enforces that a
FILLED scorecard is well-formed; SL1 makes four structural defects an ERROR.

SL1 validates STRUCTURE only. It NEVER adjudicates whether a stated "Covered" is
truly covered (that needs the table's real fields + the contract's real status -- a
Principle-V judgment). It checks, per row of the anchored status table:

  C1  the Coverage-status cell is one of the five closed enum values;
  C2  a ``Blocked -- ...`` row names a specific blocker (the Blocker cell is filled);
  C3  a ``Covered`` row's ``contracts/<file>.md`` path resolves to a tracked file
      (the contract-path-resolves invariant applies to Covered rows ONLY; Planned /
      Out of scope legitimately carry ``--``);
  C4  no ``<number>%`` token appears anywhere (the no-percentage / no-score law).

It is a pure static text read (parse committed markdown), never executes, opens no
connection, and modifies no scorecard/template file.

Ratified decisions (spec 056 ## Clarifications):
  - rule id ``SL1``; severity ERROR;
  - scan tracked ``mappings/**/*coverage-scorecard.md`` instances only -- the generic
    template file is excluded by explicit path (it is placeholders + an illustrative
    worked example by design), and ``tests/`` fixtures are excluded via is_test_path;
  - only rows in the anchored ``> Table:`` status table are parsed (a stray four-column
    table elsewhere contributes no rows);
  - no committed instance -> silent pass (mirrors PP1/G6); advances no readiness stage;
  - a tracked-but-unreadable instance fails loud (an ERROR), never crashes the gate.
