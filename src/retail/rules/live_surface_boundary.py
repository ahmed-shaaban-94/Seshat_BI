"""B3 -- live-surface import boundary guard.

The live-surface modules (``validate.py``, ``value_proxy.py``, ``semantic.py``,
``dax_gen.py``) are the ones that MAY touch a live database or read optional
dependencies -- but only LAZILY, inside the handler that actually connects. The
repo's deliberate invariant (constitution Principle VIII) is that importing any of
these modules opens nothing: every driver/network import is done inside a function,
never at module scope. Today that invariant is honored only as PROSE/policy (a
docstring + an inline ``# lazy`` comment); nothing enforces it structurally.

B3 makes it a structural ERROR rule -- the live-surface complement of B1
(``never_execute.py``), which guards the static-core modules. B3 reuses B1's
``module_scope_violations`` AST helper and forbidden-root sets UNCHANGED (Principle
II -- depend, never fork): it parses source text, it never imports or runs the
module, so the guard itself never executes. The policy inversion is only in WHICH
files are scanned -- B3's ``_LIVE_SURFACE`` set is provably disjoint from B1's
governed set, so the two halves never double-cover a file.

Severity is ERROR (matching B1): a module-scope connection-capable import in a
driver-free module is a proven breach of an absolute invariant, not a suspect
pattern with a legitimate override.

The four live-surface modules keep their driver imports lazy today, so B3 reports
zero findings on the current tree and fires only on a regression.

NOTE (ratified 2026-06-30): the registry id ``B3`` and the closed ``_LIVE_SURFACE``
set membership were resolved at the spec's ratify gate (see
``specs/048-live-surface-import-boundary-guard/spec.md`` ## Clarifications):
``metric_drift.py`` is excluded because it is an L3 *static* YAML check that opens
no connection; future live surfaces are added by a one-line set edit.
