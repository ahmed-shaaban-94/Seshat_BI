"""AL1 -- assumption-ledger rule.

A metric contract records an UNRESOLVED human judgment call through the existing
open-state mechanism the template defines: ``readiness.status == "blocked"`` with a
non-empty ``readiness.blocking_reasons[]``. Separately, a contract binds a metric to a
gold column via ``binds_to.gold_table`` + ``binds_to.columns``.

AL1 ERRORs when BOTH coexist on the same contract: a self-declared open question
(``blocked`` + reasons) presented atop a SETTLED gold binding (a real ``gold.<...>``
table -- not the ``<...>`` placeholder -- AND a non-empty, non-placeholder ``columns``
list). That combination is dishonest: the binding claims the metric is wired while the
readiness block says a blocking assumption is still open. An honest blocked DRAFT
(binding still a placeholder) does not fire; a ``pass`` contract does not fire.

AL1 is the CHECK half of the Per-Contract Ambiguity Decision Ledger (spec 058) but
depends on it for nothing -- it keys on the EXISTING readiness/binding fields, so it has
a real convention to check on day one and a genuine zero-findings baseline on ``main``
(all committed contracts are ``status: pass``). AL1 NEVER resolves the assumption
(Principle V -- that is a human ruling it cannot clear); it only surfaces the
contradiction. It is a pure static YAML read (lazy ``import yaml`` inside the function,
keeping the retail-check core stdlib-only per B1/B3), never executes, opens no
connection, and modifies no contract.

Ratified rulings (spec 059 ## Clarifications): C1 = marker is the existing ``blocked`` +
``blocking_reasons[]`` (no new token); C2 = the settled-binding trigger is a
non-placeholder ``gold_table`` AND a non-empty non-placeholder ``columns``; C3 =
standalone (not gated on the unshipped Ambiguity-Ledger define half). Scan per-table
``mappings/*/metrics/*.yaml`` only; exclude the generic template + tests/ fixtures; a
tracked-but-unreadable contract fails loud.
