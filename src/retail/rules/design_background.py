"""Design-lint rule DL2: background-spec forbidden-dynamic-content purity (surface 2).

Surface-2 sibling of DL1 (theme JSON purity, surface 3). A Power BI page
background carries STATIC STRUCTURE ONLY -- layout containers, safe zones, grid,
chrome. It is never data: a KPI value, a dynamic title, a measure result, a data
label, a refresh stamp, a filter/slicer state, or a screenshot of a live visual
must never be baked into the static background image. This rule turns the DECLARED
boolean contract of a committed filled background spec into a CI-enforced
governance check.

It asserts the spec's OWN declared booleans against the contract declared in
``templates/background-spec.yaml``:

- every ``forbidden_dynamic_content`` key MUST be the real boolean ``false``;
  a real ``true`` is a defect (ERROR); a still-present ``<true|false>``
  placeholder or any non-boolean value is malformed (ERROR).
- every ``qa_checklist`` item MUST be the real boolean ``true``, OR ``false``
  accompanied by a recorded reason (a present, non-empty, non-placeholder reason
  string); a bare ``false`` with no reason is a finding; a placeholder or a
  non-boolean value is a finding.

The rule detects reason PRESENCE only -- it NEVER judges a reason's adequacy
(Principle V). It never inspects an image binary, never renders, never interprets
free-text meaning, never computes a score, and never self-grants readiness
(FR-005, FR-012, FR-015).

Vocabulary (7 forbidden keys + 9 qa items) is frozen VERBATIM from the two
declared blocks in ``templates/background-spec.yaml`` (Clarifications Q2) -- no
tenant/example/brand literal (Principle VII). Discovery is the generic suffix
``*.background.yaml`` (Clarifications, RESOLVED 2026-07-02; analogue of DL1's
frozen ``.theme.json``), exempting ``templates/`` (the blank copy-me template) and
the test-fixture path (via ``is_test_path``). ``yaml`` is imported LAZILY inside
the check function so the module scope stays stdlib-only (B1/B3, FR-012).
