"""Rule package.

Importing this package imports every rule submodule so that each module's
``@register(...)`` decorators fire exactly once. The runner does
``import retail.rules`` at startup before calling ``registry.all_rules()``.

Add a new submodule to the import list below when you add a new rule group;
that is the *only* wiring step required for new rules to be discovered.
