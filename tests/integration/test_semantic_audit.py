"""Integration test: Dashboard Semantic Audit (spec 123, US5, FR-017/018/019/020).

The audit is a report-level coherence check, DISTINCT from the shipped
per-visual anti-pattern QA (``docs/powerbi/visual-qa.md`` /
``.claude/skills/powerbi-dashboard-design/workflows/dashboard-qa.md``): it asks
whether the WHOLE report answers its committed Report Intent, not whether any
one visual is well-formed. It emits ONLY the spec-fixed closed enum verbatim
(FR-017) -- ``covered / incomplete / missing / conflicting / warning / blocked
/ not_applicable_with_reason`` -- and MUST NOT produce any numeric score or
ranking (FR-020/FR-035).

This test sits ON the real risk (memory: verifier must sit on the risk), not
adjacent to it:

- an intent question with NO page that traces to it -> ``missing`` (US5 AC#1);
- a diagnostic-purpose report with NO driver visual represented -> ``incomplete``
  (US5 AC#2) -- checked against driver VISUAL TYPES
  (key_influencers/decomposition_tree/smart_narrative), never the intent's
  ``driver_metrics`` list (those are metric roles, not visual evidence);
- a composition whose single page carries >1 distinct intent business_question
  -> ``conflicting`` (US5 AC#3) -- the mechanical, pinned-down trigger for "a
  page lacks one coherent purpose";
- FR-020 non-recomputation, proven by construction, not by inspecting the
  helper's source (that would be a circular oracle): the audit is handed a
  REAL committed ``a11y-rtl-readiness-checklist.md`` and a recorded
  dashboard-planner-verdict fixture in a tmp repo root that has NO
  ``design/tokens/...`` file present at all -- the audit still emits findings
  that CITE those two paths and ECHO their recorded dispositions, proving it
  read-and-cited rather than re-derived (it could not have re-derived CT1 --
  the token file it would need does not exist in this tmp root).
- FR-019: every finding (not just the three headline cases) carries non-empty
  cited evidence and a named owner_or_correction (pulled from the intent's own
  ``owner`` field, never hardcoded).
- FR-017/FR-035: every finding's category is one of the closed seven, and no
  finding's rendered text contains a percent/score token anywhere (mirrors
  SL1's ``_PERCENT_RE`` guard in ``src/seshat/rules/scorecard.py``).
