"""The mapping stage's unresolved-questions mirror emitter (issue #326).

A table could clear the whole readiness spine without ever producing
``mappings/<table>/unresolved-questions.md``, then hard-fail the dbt gate
(``DBT_MAPPING_MIRROR_MISSING``) and the dagster gate (Gate status MISSING).
The emitter guarantees the mirror exists: a CLEARED stub only when the
COMMITTED readiness status records a named-human mapping_ready pass in the
audited C4 owner shape (derived from git HEAD, never invented, never from an
uncommitted worktree edit), an OPEN stub otherwise, and never overwrites the
human-authored ledger.
