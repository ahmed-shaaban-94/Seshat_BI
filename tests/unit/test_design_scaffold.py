"""`seshat scaffold-design` self-sufficiency (issues #440, #441).

The six Stage-6/7 design + handoff templates (dashboard-page-blueprint.yaml,
visual-spec.yaml, report-composition.yaml, design/grids/16x9-grid.yaml,
handoff/bi-handoff-pack.md, handoff/handoff-review-checklist.md) previously
shipped only with the development repository, and no verb materialized them
into a pip-only workspace -- so `blueprint_preview` / `dashboard_coordinator` /
the `publish_pack` rule (all of which read these as repo-relative paths) had
nothing to read. `scaffold_design` closes that gap the same way
`stage1_scaffold.scaffold_source` does for the Stage-1 templates: bundled
package data (wheel force-include), a dev-checkout fallback, and a
non-destructive write via the shared `safe_write.write_if_absent`.
