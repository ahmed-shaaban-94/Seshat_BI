"""TDD tests for the L3 contract<->DAX drift check (src/retail/metric_drift.py).

L3 of the layered DAX governance system: does a DIVIDE-based measure's DENOMINATOR
apply the filter the approved metric contract's structured `definition` declares? This
is the 50.37-vs-33.55 class -- a measure that is valid, best-practice-clean DAX yet
divides by the WRONG row-set.

Design invariants this suite locks in (from the design workflow + adversary red-team):
  * The CONTRACT's structured definition is the SOLE arbiter of direction -- never the
    DAX shape, never prose inference (the workflow's own scouts inverted 33.55/50.37 by
    reading prose; a deterministic filter-set comparison cannot be inference-inverted).
  * ESCALATE is the DEFAULT branch: a recognized predicate is compared; ANYTHING
    unrecognized escalates to a human. Never pass-on-uncertain (reopens the false
    negative), never drift-on-uncertain (the S8-over-broad false positive).
  * No bare-vs-wrapped verdict: AvgTransactionValue and DiscountedTransactionRate BOTH
    have a wrapped CALCULATE denominator; only the FILTER COLUMN differs. The
    discriminator is the filter-set, column-specific.

This module parses YAML (pyyaml, a dev/optional dep) and MUST live OUTSIDE the
`retail check` core import chain (the stdlib-only invariant) -- guarded separately.
