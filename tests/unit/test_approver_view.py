"""Tests + verifier for the Approver Decision Surface (spec 115).

The verifier centers on REFUSAL-CASE COMPLETENESS (V1/V2) -- the real risk is a
refusal-eligible item silently landing in reassurance or dropped, not ordering
flake. Per contracts/verifier.md, the question-side completeness oracle is a
HAND-AUTHORED expected set, NEVER the production parser's own output (else a
parser bug drops the row from both sides and passes vacuously).
