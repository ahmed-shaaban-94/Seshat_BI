"""Unit tests for the Additivity-Consistency Lineage Rule (spec 068, idea H1).

The rule statically cross-reads two committed define-layer facts per metric -- its
declared additivity classification (closed vocabulary "Fully additive" / "Semi-additive"
/ "Non-additive") and its derivation edges -- and ERRORs when a metric's additivity is
composed illegally per a small closed generic legality table:

  - a Non-additive (ratio/average) child composed by a DIRECT SUM  -> ILLEGAL
  - a Semi-additive component composed into a PLAIN-SUM parent      -> ILLEGAL
  - a Non-additive child recomputed base-over-base                  -> LEGAL

It acts ONLY on the exact committed classification words; an absent or
out-of-vocabulary classification on a metric that participates in a derivation
edge is ERRORed as absent/ambiguous and NEVER inferred (Principle V). An
unknown/unstated composition kind yields NO verdict (never assume SUM). It reads
committed text only, executes nothing, and emits ERROR-only findings (no score).

Fixtures are planted under a temp corpus at the real glob path so the parser is
exercised against committed-shape prose, mirroring the AL1 test harness.
