"""Writer merges: union new tables into shared source/selector files, fail closed.

Covers the two writer defects the shared ``_sources.yml`` / ``selectors.yml``
merges must not have: (1) a second onboarded table must have its tables UNIONED
into the existing ``bronze`` / ``migration_gold`` groups, not skipped because the
group name already exists; (2) a malformed existing file must fail closed, never
be clobbered with only the new rows (destroying other tables' entries).
