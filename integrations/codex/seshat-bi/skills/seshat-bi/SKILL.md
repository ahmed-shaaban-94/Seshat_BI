# Seshat BI

Read `../../portable-operating-contract.md` before acting. Inspect the current
workspace and use installed `seshat` commands when available. If the workspace
has no `AGENTS.md`, this skill's portable operating contract still applies.

For subject reasoning, load only the relevant bundled skill:

- SQL and source grain: `bi-sql-knowledge`
- DAX and semantic measures: `bi-dax-knowledge`
- Python/dataframe preparation: `bi-python-knowledge`
- distributed data: `bi-bigdata-knowledge`
- retail KPI meaning and contracts: `retail-kpi-knowledge`
- Power BI design, review, theme, formatting, and PBIP adoption:
  `powerbi-workflows`
- governed dbt prerequisite, plan, shadow build, and evidence review:
  `dbt-workflows`
- governed Dagster preflight, gated medallion runs, and run-evidence review:
  `dagster-workflows`

End with one next action or one blocked stop. Cite evidence and named blockers;
never invent a pass or score.

## Discovering the surface (no name memorization needed)

A user or agent only needs this skill's name; everything else self-describes:

- On Claude Code, `/seshat-bi:help` prints the full installed command map; on
  Codex, the routing list above IS the map (there are no Codex slash
  commands).
- `seshat --help` lists every installed CLI verb, and
  `seshat next --format agent` returns the one machine-readable governed next
  action -- always prefer it over guessing a verb or a stage.
- Use only the commands, verbs, and skill names those surfaces report; never
  invent a name, and if `seshat` is not installed, say so and point to
  `pipx install seshat-bi` instead of simulating output.

## Agent-driven loop (programmatic automation)

For fully programmatic automation, the optional read-only MCP governor
(`seshat mcp --repo <workspace>`, installed via `pipx install "seshat-bi[mcp]"`)
exposes six tools: `seshat_get_status`, `seshat_get_next_action`,
`seshat_explain_blockers`, `seshat_prepare_approval_request`,
`seshat_run_static_check`, and `seshat_export_evidence_pack`.

The governed loop is: get the next action, perform exactly that one action,
re-run the static check, and repeat. When the next action is a named-human
decision, call `seshat_prepare_approval_request` to package it and STOP -- no
tool in this loop grants an approval, advances a stage, or emits a score, and
the loop must never route around a blocked gate.

## Existing PBIP projects

For an existing Power BI Project, first use the installed read-only entry path:

```powershell
seshat adopt-pbip assess --project <PBIP-project-directory> --format text
```

Treat PBIP structure as candidate evidence only. The assessment must not create
or approve mappings, metrics, business meaning, or readiness passes. It returns
one governed next action and an assessment digest. A `.pbix` is a conversion
boundary: save it as PBIP in Power BI Desktop before continuing.

Only after a human reviews the exact digest, and only in a clean existing Git
worktree, may the agent run:

```powershell
seshat adopt-pbip scaffold --project <PBIP-project-directory> --accept-assessment <assessment-digest>
```

This writes at most `.seshat/adoption/pbip-adoption.yaml`; it never initializes
Git, overwrites existing files, grants approval, or advances readiness.

## Resetting / re-running a project

There is no `seshat reset` verb yet (tracked separately). Until it ships, reset
a single table's derived state by hand, preserving its bronze landing, then
re-run readiness from Source.

**STOP first -- two cases this manual reset does NOT cover; hand them to the
owner rather than deleting blindly:**

1. **Shared conformed dimension.** If this table OWNS a conformed dimension that
   another star reuses, its `dbt/models/marts/<table>/` holds the sole dbt model
   the reuser resolves via `ref()` (the kit emits no duplicate model for
   non-owners). Deleting the marts folder would break the other star's build.
   Check `docs/quality/conformed-dimension-map.yaml`: if this table is the OWNER
   of any dimension listed with other-star reusers, **do not run this manual
   reset** -- ownership transfer / dependent regeneration is an owner decision.
2. **Downstream Power BI artifacts.** If this table reached Semantic Model or
   Dashboard, committed `powerbi/*.SemanticModel` / report artifacts still point
   at the gold objects you are about to remove. This checklist does NOT rewrite
   or quarantine them -- leaving them would let Power BI keep reading stale gold
   while `seshat next` reports Source. If a `powerbi/` artifact references this
   table's gold entities, **stop and hand the PBIP teardown to the owner** (a
   shared semantic model especially must be handled explicitly, never bulk
   deleted).

If neither case applies (no conformed-dimension ownership, no downstream PBIP),
this table's artifacts are table-local and the reset below is safe.

First LIST what you are about to remove and confirm every path is for THIS
table -- never delete by a bare `<table>*` wildcard. A prefix wildcard is
dangerous when one table id is a prefix of another (e.g. `orders` also matches
`orders_archive`): `*_create_silver_<table>*.sql` would sweep the other table's
migrations too, and a later broad `git add` would then stage that unrelated data
loss. Enumerate the exact migration files and eyeball them before removing:

```powershell
# 1. Enumerate the migration SQL for THIS table -- review the list first.
Get-ChildItem warehouse/migrations |
  Where-Object { $_.Name -match "_create_(silver|gold)_<table>(_|\.)" }
```

Once the list is confirmed to contain only this table's files, remove the
derived artifacts (exact per-table paths, not prefix globs):

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force mappings/<table>
# remove ONLY the confirmed migration files from the list above, e.g.:
Remove-Item -Force warehouse/migrations/0003_create_silver_<table>.sql
Remove-Item -Force warehouse/migrations/0004_create_gold_<table>_star.sql
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dbt/models/staging/<table>
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dbt/models/marts/<table>
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dbt/models/audit/<table>
```

This covers `mappings/<table>/` (including its nested `dbt-evidence/`
subfolder -- it lives under the mapping directory, not as a separate
top-level path), the silver and gold migration SQL for that table (plus any
generated `warehouse/gold/` or `warehouse/schema/` outputs), and the three
per-table dbt model folders. Do not touch the bronze landing. In a multi-table
workspace, also confirm the shared dbt files (`dbt/models/sources/_sources.yml`,
`dbt/selectors.yml`) no longer reference this table's gold entities -- edit out
only this table's rows, leaving other tables' rows intact.

The materialized dagster project under `orchestration/dagster/` is
regenerable rather than hand-edited; if it references the removed table,
regenerate it with `seshat dagster init`.

Stage the deletions before running `seshat check` -- an unstaged delete can
leave the static gate reading stale tracked content. Stage the SPECIFIC paths
you removed (and the shared-file edits), not a blanket `git add -A` -- a bare
`-A` would also stage any unrelated working-tree change, including a mistaken
deletion of another table's files:

```powershell
# stage exactly the paths reset above -- review `git status` first
git add mappings/<table> `
        warehouse/migrations/0003_create_silver_<table>.sql `
        warehouse/migrations/0004_create_gold_<table>_star.sql `
        dbt/models/staging/<table> dbt/models/marts/<table> `
        dbt/models/audit/<table> `
        dbt/models/sources/_sources.yml dbt/selectors.yml
seshat check
seshat next --format agent --table <table>
```

Then verify no residual state remains by inspecting the per-table and shared
artifacts directly -- do NOT rely on `.seshat/manifest.yaml`, which records the
kit's integrity fingerprint (kit-source / compass / integration receipts), not
onboarded tables, so it never mentions a table and would give a false
all-clear. A truthful reset means: `mappings/<table>/` is gone, no
`*_<table>*.sql` migration remains, the three `dbt/models/*/<table>/` folders
are gone, and the shared dbt files carry no rows for this table. Pass
`--table <table>` to `seshat next` so it reports THIS table's stage (without it,
`next` focuses the portfolio's most urgent OTHER table and cannot confirm the
reset) -- it should now report a fresh Source stage; if it does not, the reset
is incomplete.
