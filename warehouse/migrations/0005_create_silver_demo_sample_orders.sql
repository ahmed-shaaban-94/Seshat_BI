-- 0005_create_silver_demo_sample_orders.sql
-- Build silver.demo_sample_orders (typed/cleaned order-line fact) from the demo
-- sample source (spec 083 local demo harness; GENERIC invented data, not C086).
--
-- Medallion: bronze = faithful TEXT landing; silver = typed/cleaned flat table;
-- gold (0006) = Kimball star. Power BI reads gold, not silver.
--
-- Grain: one order line. PK = (order_id). 24 sample rows.
-- Idempotent: DROP+CREATE in one transaction; safe to re-run.
--
-- Cleaning rules from the APPROVED mappings/demo_sample_orders/ (gate CLEARED).
-- RC7 type discipline: quantity -> INTEGER; unit_price/line_total -> exact NUMERIC
-- (money); order_id kept TEXT (alphanumeric id). ASCII only; UTF-8 no BOM.
