-- 0005_create_silver_sales_c086.sql
-- Build silver.sales_c086 (typed/cleaned line-item fact) from bronze.sales_c086_raw.
--
-- SUPERSEDES 0001_create_silver_sales_c086.sql. Authoritative silver build for the
-- FINAL approved map (mappings/sales_c086/, gate CLEARED via PR #86, 2026-06-29).
-- Differs from 0001 by design:
--   * 2 measures only: gross_sales + quantity (net/tax/discount dropped -- RC9 deviation).
--   * Generated surrogate PK sale_sk; natural key (invoice_no, line_no) kept SILVER-ONLY
--     for the uniqueness/dedup proof (NOT exposed to gold).
--   * buyer -> product_purchaser (its own gold dim 0006), not a folded attribute.
--   * customer 'C086' (site code) -> customer_id_clean = 'WALK_IN' (value remap).
--   * billing English label keyed on the CODE (no Arabic literals in this file).
--   * NO business_segment rollup (none analyst-supplied -- RC11).
--
-- Identifiers are snake_case unquoted (rule S1). PascalCase display names
-- (Product_ID, Gross_Sales, ...) are applied LATER in the Power BI model layer, not here.
-- Both 0005/0006 are DROP+CREATE in one txn -> safe to re-run; latest build wins.
--
-- Grain: invoice LINE ITEM. 249,106 bronze -> 246,916 silver. Save UTF-8 without BOM.
