# Reconciliation Report -- `<table_id>`

> **GENERIC TEMPLATE.** This is the blank that a table's live acceptance run fills.
> Copy it per table, replace every `<placeholder>`, and record real numbers. It is one of

> silver and gold are built and a live DB is reachable.

> For a **filled instance**, see `docs/worked-examples/c086-pharmacy.md` section 5 plus
> `docs/c086-adr0002-compliance.md` (C086: 246,916 silver rows, penny-exact across 5

## What this report is (and is not)

This report documents the **LIVE acceptance gates** for a medallion table: the checks that
can only be proven against a *running* database, not from committed text. They correspond
to the playbook's **Phase 5/6 validation gates** and to ADR 0002 defaults **RC2, RC15, RC16**
(`docs/decisions/0002-retail-cleaning-defaults.md`).

> **These four categories are the DEFERRED LIVE surface.** They are the seed for a future
> `retail validate` command (architecture doc Sec 7; worked example Sec 8). **No validator is
> implemented in this slice** -- this template documents the *categories* only. Today the run
> is performed by hand (a read-only analyst/agent session) and the results are pasted in
> below. The static, CI-able governance gate is the separate, already-shipped `retail check`
> (23 rules, `src/retail/`); it does **not** cover these -- these need the data.

> **Namespace note (disambiguated -- feature 002):** the ADR ids cited here (`RC2`, `RC15`,
> `RC16`) are **ADR 0002 cleaning/modeling defaults** ("retail cleaning"), distinct from the
> governance checker's `D1-D8` TMDL/DAX rules. Distinct prefixes, no collision: a cleaning
> default reads `RC<n>`, a checker rule reads `D<n>`.

## Run header

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Table id | `<table_id>` (e.g. the silver/gold object family for this table) |
| Silver object | `silver.<table_name>` |
| Gold objects | `gold.fct_<...>` + `gold.dim_<...>` (one fact at silver grain + conformed dims) |
| Run date | `<YYYY-MM-DD>` |
| DB cluster | `<cluster_id>` (e.g. region/host identifier) |
| Database | `<database_name>` (the DB that actually holds the data -- confirm it is not an empty default) |
| Run by | `<analyst_or_agent>` |
| Connection | **READ-ONLY.** Credentials from the git-ignored `.env` (never committed; Power BI uses parameters, not baked-in strings). No writes are performed by this run. |

> **Read-only is a hard requirement.** This is an acceptance/validation run, not a build run.
> Connect with a read-only role and credentials sourced only from `.env`.

## 1. PK uniqueness (ADR RC2)

**Gate:** the silver table's row count equals the count of distinct primary-key tuples, and
there are **zero NULL PK** values. Verify on the *transformed* (silver) rows, not the raw
source -- TRIM/cast can collapse or null keys (ADR RC2; playbook Phase 5).

| Check | Expected | Observed |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Silver row count | `<N>` | `<N>` |
| Distinct PK tuples `(<pk_cols>)` | `<N>` (= row count) | `<N>` |
| NULL PK values | `0` | `<n>` |

**Result:** `<N>` rows = `<N>` distinct `(<pk_cols>)`, `0` NULL PK -> **`<PASS|FAIL>`**.

> Filled instance: see worked example section 5 (C086 silver = distinct PK = 246,916, 0 NULL).

---

## 2. Date-dim coverage (ADR RC15)

**Gate:** the gold date dimension is a **contiguous generated calendar** (built from a
`generate_series` over the full span, never `SELECT DISTINCT date`) that spans **every** real
date present in the fact, with **zero** real dates missing from the calendar (ADR RC15;
playbook Phase 6).

| Check | Expected | Observed |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Calendar span | `<min_date>` .. `<max_date>` | `<min_date>` .. `<max_date>` |
| Calendar row count | `<N_days>` (= exact contiguous span, no gaps) | `<N_days>` |
| Contiguous (no missing interior days) | yes | `<yes|no>` |
| Real fact dates outside the calendar | `0` | `<n>` |

**Result:** calendar spans every `<date_column>`, contiguous, `0` missing -> **`<PASS|FAIL>`**.

> Note: the *pattern* half of RC15 (generate_series vs distinct) is statically checkable from
> the migration SQL and is a future `retail check` candidate; the *coverage* half here is the
> live half and cannot be proven from text (worked example sections 7-8).

---

## 3. Orphan FKs (ADR RC16)

**Gate:** **zero hard orphan FKs** across all dimensions -- every fact FK resolves to a real
dimension surrogate key. The gold star's `-1` unknown-member pattern (ADR RC14) absorbs
unresolved keys *without* creating an orphan, so a clean migration with FK constraints added
after load implies 0 hard orphans. Separately, count the rows landing on each `-1` unknown
member: those are **not** orphans, but they are a **data-quality signal** worth surfacing to
the analyst (ADR RC16; playbook Phase 6).

| Dimension | Hard orphan FKs (expected `0`) | Rows on `-1` unknown member (DQ signal) |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `dim_<...>` | `<n>` | `<n>` |
| `dim_<...>` | `<n>` | `<n>` |
| `dim_<...>` | `<n>` | `<n>` |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Result:** `0` hard orphan FKs across all dims -> **`<PASS|FAIL>`**.
**DQ signals:** `<dim>` has `<n>` rows on `-1` (`<short description of the known gap>`).

> Filled instance: worked example section 5 records 0 hard orphans across 6 dims, with 71
> fact rows on the salesperson `-1` member flagged as a known attribution gap (not a defect).

---

## 4. Cross-layer measure reconciliation (ADR RC16)

**Gate:** every measure total matches **to the penny** across layers -- source -> silver ->
gold (-> BI). Reconcile **every** measure, not a sample; a single-cent drift is a FAIL to be
explained, not rounded away (ADR RC16; playbook Phase 5/6). Include the BI column once an
Import-mode model exists; until then it may be left `<n/a>`.

| Measure | Source | Silver | Gold | BI | Match? |
|---------|--------|--------|------|----|--------|
| `<measure_1>` | `<total>` | `<total>` | `<total>` | `<total|n/a>` | `<yes|no>` |
| `<measure_2>` | `<total>` | `<total>` | `<total>` | `<total|n/a>` | `<yes|no>` |
| `<measure_3>` | `<total>` | `<total>` | `<total>` | `<total|n/a>` | `<yes|no>` |
| `<measure_n>` | `<total>` | `<total>` | `<total>` | `<total|n/a>` | `<yes|no>` |
| Row count | `<N>` | `<N>` | `<N>` | `<N|n/a>` | `<yes|no>` |

**Result:** all `<k>` measures reconcile to the penny across layers -> **`<PASS|FAIL>`**.

> Filled instance: worked example section 5 reconciles 5 C086 measures silver<->gold penny-exact
> (with the fact row count equal across silver and gold).

## Verdict

| Category | ADR | Playbook | Result |
|----------|-----|----------|--------|
| 1. PK uniqueness | RC2 | Phase 5 | `<PASS|FAIL>` |
| 2. Date-dim coverage | RC15 | Phase 6 | `<PASS|FAIL>` |
| 3. Orphan FKs | RC16 | Phase 6 | `<PASS|FAIL>` |
| 4. Cross-layer reconciliation | RC16 | Phase 5/6 | `<PASS|FAIL>` |

**Overall:** **`<PASS|FAIL>`** -- `<one-line summary; e.g. "all four live gates pass; N DQ
signals noted for analyst follow-up" or "FAIL on category X, see notes">`.

> A FAIL here blocks "build done." Per ADR RC16 the build is not declared complete until
> 0 orphan FKs and penny-exact cross-layer totals are proven on the live data.
