# CLAUDE.md — Seshat BI

Repo-specific rules. Global rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` still apply.

## What this repo is

A **standalone analytics service** — NOT bound by the Retail Tower OS
orchestrator / contract-boundary rules. Power BI primary; DigitalOcean Postgres
source. Data flows `raw` → `marts` → Power BI.

For new retail mart work, start from `docs/worked-examples/c086-pharmacy.md` and follow the medallion playbook.

## Hard rules

- **Secrets:** credentials only in `.env` (git-ignored). Never write real values
  into tracked files. Power BI uses parameters, not baked-in connection strings.
- **PBIP `.gitignore` baseline is exact:** `**/.pbi/localSettings.json` and
  `**/.pbi/cache.abf`. Never ignore `definition/` folders — that's the model.
- **PBIP is a preview feature** (as of 2025-12); enable it in Power BI Desktop.
- **Windows 260-char path limit** — keep PBIP project/table names short.
- **Line endings:** `core.autocrlf=true`; rely on `.gitattributes`. Edit PBIP
  text externally only as UTF-8 without BOM.

## Conventions

SQL: `snake_case`; schemas `raw`/`marts`; `vw_`/`fct_`/`dim_` prefixes; numbered
idempotent migrations. DAX: `PascalCase` measures in display folders. Full detail
in `docs/conventions.md`.

## Scope discipline (YAGNI)

No live DB provisioning, no automated ingestion code, no orchestrator integration
unless explicitly requested. Add the seam, not the implementation.
