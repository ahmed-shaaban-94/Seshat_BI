# visual-implementation-review (surface 4: verify the built page)

Surface 4 of the four-surface router (`../SKILL.md`), ALONGSIDE `powerbi-handoff.md`.
Where the handoff produces the build NOTES a human follows, this workflow VERIFIES
the result: it reads the committed plain-text PBIR -- built either by a HUMAN in
Power BI Desktop, or (spec 123, US7) by the bounded, ADR-0017-ratified blueprint
compiler (`seshat.pbir_compile`) -- and produces the implementation TRACE proving
the page realizes the approved visual -> contract binding map 1:1 -- and nothing
more. It is the review, not the build, regardless of which of those two paths
produced the committed page. (On-disk spec: `specs/039-visual-implementation-mvp`;
roadmap feature: F034 -- the roadmap F-number is authoritative when it disagrees
with the spec-dir number. Spec 123 US8 extends this workflow's scope to also
compare against the approved page BLUEPRINT, not just the binding map -- see
`../../../../specs/123-governed-dashboard-intelligence/spec.md` FR-030/FR-031 and
the companion read-only `retail pbir-validate-blueprint` CLI verb.)

## Scope (read first)

This workflow READS a committed page and WRITES a derived trace; it authors nothing
in Power BI. It edits no PBIP/PBIR file, generates no PBIR, writes no DAX, changes no
SQL, edits no semantic-model file, hand-edits no Desktop-owned file
(`report.json` / `diagramLayout.json`), hand-authors no visual-container JSON, runs
no pbi-cli / Power BI MCP command, and publishes nothing -- this holds identically
whether the page under review was a human's Desktop save or the US7 compiler's
output. Execution against the **Power BI Service** (publish / refresh / export /
schedule) is F016's job and remains forbidden and deferred regardless of which
authoring path produced the committed PBIR; this workflow stops at the review
boundary and names F016 as that owner. F034 is INDEPENDENT of F016 -- rule 6 gates
Service-publish automation, not on-disk PBIR authoring (human OR compiler; see the
boundary section below).

It defines no metric (that is F009) and designs/re-binds no dashboard (that is the
F011/012 `dashboard-design` verb). It only verifies that the committed page --
however it was authored -- matches what those upstream artifacts already
approved -- referencing each by name, never re-deriving it.

## What this workflow consumes

The review is downstream of the build. Gather these inputs first; if one is missing,
the review is `blocked` until it exists (do not invent it):

| Input | What it provides | Where it comes from |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| The committed PBIR page | the BUILT visuals to verify -- one visual container per built visual, in plain text | a human's Desktop save, OR the US7 compiler's committed output, under `<report>/definition/pages/<id>/` |
| Approved visual -> contract binding map | the 1:1 source of truth: each measure-bearing visual -> exactly one approved contract by name + mapped field | F011/012 (`mappings/<subject>/design/visual-contract-binding-map.md`) |
| The design-review sign-off | the recorded approval the build realizes | `approvals[]` in `mappings/<subject>/readiness-status.yaml` |
| The trace template | the copy-me blank this workflow fills | `../../../../templates/visual-implementation-trace.md` |
| F011A handoff notes | the build order the page should reflect (restated, never re-derived) | `powerbi-handoff.md` |

Reference each input BY NAME or relative path. This generic workflow inlines no
concrete subject-area value: contracts/fields stay placeholders (e.g.
`<ApprovedContract>`, `<dim[col]>`). Worked values live only in the per-subject
filled trace instance.

## Gate check before reviewing (inherited VERBATIM from Dashboard Ready, rule 5)

Confirm the inherited gate is satisfied BEFORE recording any implemented-page
evidence -- this workflow re-decides nothing; the gate is owned by
`docs/readiness/dashboard-ready.md` + F011/012:

- the subject area's `semantic_model_ready` MUST be `pass`, AND
- the design-review sign-off MUST be recorded in `approvals[]`, AND
- the approved binding map MUST exist.

If any fails, record the blocking reason and STOP -- record NO implemented-page
evidence, do not bless a build whose design is not approved:

- `semantic_model_ready` not `pass` -> `blocking_reason: "no approved contracts -- Dashboard Ready gate, rule 5"`.
- sign-off not recorded -> `blocking_reason: "design-review sign-off not recorded"`.
- binding map missing -> `blocking_reason: "approved binding map missing"`.

A page may be built before the gate clears, but it is never BLESSED as implemented
evidence until the gate holds.

## Output: the implementation trace (read the page, fill the template)

Copy `../../../../templates/visual-implementation-trace.md` to the subject area's
design dir (`mappings/<subject>/design/visual-implementation-trace.md`) and fill it
by READING the committed page, in this order:

1. **Enumerate the built measure-bearing visuals** -- read each visual container in
   `<report>/definition/pages/<id>/` (and its `visuals/` if Desktop split them). A
   filter-rail dimension SLICER binds no measure -- it is NOT a trace row (the trace
   governs measure-bearing visuals only, matching the F011/012 binding-map convention).
2. **Trace each visual 1:1 to the approved binding map** -- one row per built
   measure-bearing visual: the contract it binds to (BY NAME) and the mapped
   semantic-model field(s). The binding map is the source of truth, never the visual's
   on-page caption.
3. **Status each row** from the readiness four-status set (never a number):
   - `pass` -- binds 1:1 to exactly one approved contract by name AND a mapped model field.
   - `blocked` -- an ORPHAN visual (not in the approved binding map) OR an UNMAPPED field
     (absent from the governed model). Record the reason; this row can never be `pass`.
   - `warning` -- a non-blocking divergence to surface (an accepted layout deviation, or a
     built visual whose map entry was re-approved upstream and now diverges) that does not
     by itself retract the design approval.
   - `not_started` -- an approved binding-map entry with NO built visual yet.
4. **Run the coverage check** -- every approved binding-map entry is accounted for: built
   (`pass`), `not_started` (no built visual yet), or `warning` (map re-approved, page now
   diverges). A built visual NOT in the approved map is an orphan -> `blocked`.
5. **Carry any contract caveat** the visual must surface (an excluded population, a
   floor/ceiling framing) -- restate the CONTRACT's approved framing, never a redefinition
   (F009) and never a retracted/stale figure.
6. **Roll up to the WORST row status** -- any `blocked` -> `blocked`; else any `warning` or
   `not_started` -> that; else `pass`. Record `evidence[]` + `blocking_reasons[]`.

For each visual, the trace row says "binds to contract `<name>`, field `<field>`" -- it
NEVER contains the metric's formula or any DAX. Verifying a binding is matching the visual's
selected measure to an existing approved contract, not authoring a definition here.

## The git-diff review checklist (a reviewer runs this on the committed PBIR)

The page is reviewed in git like code -- the reviewer reads plain text, never an opaque
`.pbix`. Confirm, on the committed diff:

- [ ] The change is EITHER a real Power BI Desktop SAVE, OR the ADR-0017-ratified
      US7 compiler's committed output (`seshat.pbir_compile.compile_page_shell` /
      `compile_line_chart`) -- never ad-hoc hand-authored visual-container JSON
      from any other source, and never a hand-edit to `report.json` /
      `diagramLayout.json` (FR-009; those stay Desktop- or adapter-owned files,
      never freehand-edited).
- [ ] No opaque `.pbix` is committed -- the page is plain-text PBIR (FR-002).
- [ ] The PBIR references the governed semantic model by a RELATIVE path -- never an
      absolute/remote ref, never a real host (FR-007; the same constraint `retail check`
      R1 enforces).
- [ ] One visual container per approved measure-bearing visual; no visual the binding map
      did not approve (no orphan).
- [ ] The filled `visual-implementation-trace.md` accompanies the page diff, and its
      overall status matches the rows.
- [ ] Committed files are ASCII, UTF-8 without BOM; the nested `definition/pages/<id>/...`
      paths stay under the Windows 260-char limit (FR-014).
- [ ] A contract caveat (e.g. a discount rate's excluded/floor framing) is surfaced on the
      visual and agrees with the trace -- the APPROVED framing, never a retracted/stale one.

## The 1:1 trace check (the load-bearing rule)

Every measure-bearing visual on the built page maps to EXACTLY ONE approved metric contract
(by name) from the approved binding map AND to a field present in the governed semantic
model. A measure reused across visuals is still ONE contract bound multiple ways (allowed);
a visual with NO approved contract behind it is an orphan and forbidden. The page cannot
silently introduce an unapproved metric, an orphan visual, or an unmapped field -- any of
those forces the trace `blocked`, never `pass`.

## No-author / review boundary (and the F016 line)

This workflow READS a committed page and WRITES a derived trace; it authors no PBIR.
It edits no PBIP/PBIR/semantic-model file, generates no PBIR, writes no DAX, changes no SQL,
runs no pbi-cli / Power BI MCP command, and publishes nothing. The committed page it reads
was built by ONE of two authorized paths -- a HUMAN action in Power BI Desktop, or the
bounded, ADR-0017-ratified US7 compiler (`seshat.pbir_compile`) -- and this workflow's role
is identical either way: VERIFY the committed result and produce the reviewable trace. It
never authors, never re-derives, and never favors one authorized path's output over the
other's when comparing against the approved design.

- **F016 is EXECUTION AUTOMATION AGAINST THE POWER BI SERVICE** (a future adapter that would
  publish/refresh/export/schedule a report without a human) -- deferred, gated (rule 6), and
  named here as the owner of any Service-facing step. F016 is NOT about who authors the
  on-disk PBIR (human or compiler); it is about the still-forbidden step of putting that PBIR
  in front of the Service.
- **F034 is the REVIEW of on-disk PBIR reviewed in git**, authored by EITHER a human building
  in Desktop and committing plain-text PBIR, OR the US7 compiler staging + committing its
  bounded, allow-listed output; the only "tooling" this workflow itself runs is git diff +
  this read-only trace (extended, per US8, by the companion read-only `retail
  pbir-validate-blueprint` CLI verb). It is INDEPENDENT of F016: rule 6 gates Service-publish
  automation, not on-disk authoring (by either path), and no readiness stage depends on F016.

If a user asks to "just generate the report", "run pbi-cli", or "publish to the workspace",
STOP at the review boundary, produce or verify only the committed PBIR (however it was
authored), and name F016 as the owner of any generation-against-the-Service or publish step.
The US7 compiler itself already stops before publish (FR-036) -- this workflow does not
relax that boundary, it verifies against it.

## Readiness (recorded, not granted)

Record `dashboard_ready` with the four statuses (`not_started` / `blocked` / `warning` /
`pass`) plus `evidence[]` and `blocking_reasons[]`; never a numeric score (rule 9). The
implemented-page result is recorded ONLY as an `evidence[]` item under the EXISTING Dashboard
Ready owner (`evidence: built-page traces to the approved binding map; R1 passes`). Building
the page never DOWNGRADES a legitimately approved design; a build-time divergence is a new
`warning` / `blocked` finding on the page, not a retraction of the design approval. NEVER
self-grant `dashboard_ready: pass` -- that stays the F011/012 verb owner's recorded
design-review action.

## Stop-and-ask (Principle V)

STOP and surface to a human rather than self-answering when:

- a required input (the committed page, the binding map, the governed model, the sign-off)
  is missing -- record the blocking reason and STOP, do not invent it;
- a user asks to generate the PBIR, run pbi-cli/MCP, or publish -- verify only the committed
  page and name F016 as the owner of any execution step;
- whether a built page FAITHFULLY realizes the approved design, whether a layout deviation
  discovered at build time is acceptable, or whether the design-review sign-off COVERS the
  built page is a judgment call -- surface it to the BI owner; never self-answer or
  self-grant `dashboard_ready: pass`.
