description: >-
  Run dbt as the build ENGINE for silver/gold ONLY behind the Mapping Ready gate,
  and record its run/test/parity output as DERIVED evidence -- never as an approval.
  Use when someone asks to build silver/gold for a mapped table with dbt, run dbt
  tests, or check dbt parity against the existing gold tables in the Seshat BI repo.
  dbt is the engine; Tower BI is the brain. This skill READS the approved map,
  EXECUTES approved dbt steps behind the gate, and WRITES evidence; it never defines
  meaning, never moves a stage to pass, and HARD-STOPS at every human judgment call.

# dbt-transformation-adapter

- **Authority category (F024):** Execution Adapter / `DB-connected` (NOT publish-capable).
- **Roadmap feature:** F029  **On-disk spec:** `specs/023-dbt-transformation-adapter`.

dbt is the build ENGINE: it compiles SQL, materializes models, and runs tests. Tower BI
is the brain: it owns the approved source-map, the metric contracts, and the readiness
spine, and routes every judgment call to a named human. This skill is how the agent runs
dbt without letting it become the brain. You (the agent reading this) ARE the runtime; this
skill is procedure, not an engine -- there is no daemon, no scheduler, no auto-approver.
See `docs/decisions/0009-dbt-is-transformation-adapter.md` and
`templates/dbt-adapter-contract.md`.

> NOTE: This skill's PROCEDURE is authored now; the dbt RUNTIME project it drives does not
> exist yet. The dbt project (`dbt/` -- models, tests, macros, `dbt_project.yml`) is a
> PLANNED future output (the build slice creates it) -- see the enumerated shape in
> `docs/integrations/dbt-adapter.md`. Until the dbt project exists, treat every "run dbt
> ..." step below as a seam to report, not a command to fake.

## Scope boundary (read first)

Invoke-and-record only. This skill runs dbt behind the gate and records its findings as
evidence; it does NOT define source mapping, metric contracts, or semantic logic, does NOT
publish Power BI, and does NOT move a readiness stage to `pass`. Three non-negotiables:

- **The entry gate is the FIRST refusal point** (Principle IV). dbt may run NO
  staging/silver/gold model for a table whose `mappings/<table>/readiness-status.yaml`
  does not record Mapping Ready = `pass`. Refuse + record a `blocking_reason`. The presence
  of dbt model files is NOT permission to build.
- **A green `dbt test` is EVIDENCE, never an approval** (the governance hinge). Record the
  pass/fail counts as `evidence[]` / `blocking_reasons[]`; Tower readiness + a named human
  move Silver/Gold Ready to `pass`, citing that evidence + the approval. There is NO path
  by which a green run alone writes `pass`.
- **dbt stops at gold** (Principle III). dbt is `DB-connected`, not publish-capable;
  materializing/publishing a Power BI model is the parked F016 adapter, gated separately.

**ASCII only, UTF-8 no BOM** in everything you author (`--`, `->`; no em-dash / smart-quote
/ unicode-arrow).

## Run-state: read mappings/<table>/ FIRST (no new state file)

Compute what you may do from what is already on disk -- there is NO dbt orchestration state
file to create:

| What you observe | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| `mappings/<table>/readiness-status.yaml` missing, or Mapping Ready not `pass` | **REFUSE.** Record a `blocking_reason` ("Mapping Ready not pass"); run no model. |
| Mapping Ready = `pass`, approved `source-map.yaml` present | **Permitted** to run staging/silver/gold models that CITE the approved map. |
| A dbt model builds a meaning (grain/PK/PII/placement) the map does NOT state | **DEFECT.** The model cites the map, it does not extend it; the map is re-approved first. |
| The table is already built by migrations | The dbt mart must pass the **reconciliation parity test** before it can become the build path. |

You may READ Mapping Ready; you may NOT write `pass` to any stage (that is the named human's
action). Read the approved map by path + git ref; every model must cite it.

## Fixed sequence (run dbt only behind the gate)

| Step | What you do | Authority note |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 Check the gate | Read `mappings/<table>/readiness-status.yaml`. If Mapping Ready is not `pass` -> REFUSE + record `blocking_reason`. | Entry gate (Principle IV). |
| 2 Verify citations | Confirm each planned model carries a model contract (`templates/dbt-model-contract.md`) citing the approved map (path + git ref + rows for grain/PK/each column). A column with no citation is a DEFECT -> block. | dbt reads truth; never authors it. |
| 3 Build | Run `dbt build` (staging -> silver -> gold) for the table. | Execute an approved step. |
| 4 Test | Run `dbt test` (`unique` / `not_null` / `relationships` + the reconciliation parity test). | Evidence, never approval. |
| 5 Parity | Run the reconciliation parity test vs the migration-built gold fact (four assertions below). | Evidence; a human approves any switch. |
| 6 Record evidence | Write the run/test/parity results as `evidence[]` / `blocking_reasons[]` into `mappings/<table>/readiness-status.yaml`. Leave the stage status unchanged. | DERIVED evidence only. |
| 7 Recommend + STOP | Recommend a stage transition or a build-path switch; STOP for a named human to decide. | Never self-approve. |

## The reconciliation parity test (four assertions, exact to the cent)

For a table already built by migrations, assert against the migration-built gold fact:

1. equal fact row count;
2. preserved distinct count of the fact's degenerate / business key;
3. each additive money-measure sum equal to the cent -- absolute delta `<= 0.01` per
   additive measure, matching the committed money scale (e.g. `NUMERIC(12,2)`);
4. equal per-dimension distinct member counts -- each conformed dimension's member count,
   including any unknown / sentinel member where the gold model defines one.

A mismatch -> record the measured delta as a `blocking_reason`, keep Gold Ready `blocked`,
keep migrations the default. After an approved switch, the migration files are RETAINED as
the parity oracle; the parity test RE-RUNS on EVERY dbt build while the oracle is retained
(never one-time-at-switch). The cent tolerance is the stated default -- NOT a score.

## HARD-STOP: the Principle V judgment calls (never auto-resolve)

STOP and escalate to a named human; record an owner row -- do not edit around any of these:

- a grain ambiguity, or a model that would change the declared grain (e.g. collapse line
  items) -- forbidden without a re-approved map.
- a sentinel-vs-null choice (e.g. an unknown-member handling that diverges from the
  migration's sentinel -- the parity test catches the divergence; resolving it is a human call).
- a PII publish-safety question on any column.
- a business rollup / segment mapping the map does not answer.
- moving Silver Ready / Gold Ready to `pass` -- always a named-human approval, never a
  green `dbt test`.
- a build-path switch (migrations -> dbt) -- only after parity passes AND a human approves;
  never flip the default on your own; never delete the migration oracle.
- any dbt-core / dbt-postgres major (and, until compatibility tests exist, minor) version
  bump -- a named reviewer approves; no automerge.

## Seams (deferred by design -- report and park, never fake)

- **The dbt project itself** -- `dbt/` (models, tests, macros, `dbt_project.yml`) is a
  PLANNED future output (see `docs/integrations/dbt-adapter.md`). Until it exists, state
  that the build slice creates it and STOP; never fabricate a dbt run.
- **A live dbt run** -- needs the DB + a git-ignored `profiles.yml` (only
  `profiles.example.yml` with placeholders is committed; Principle IX). Without it, report
  the boundary + the enable steps (supply `profiles.yml` from the example); never traceback,
  never fake a pass.
- **The Power BI build** -- F016 (parked, publish-capable, gated on Semantic Model Ready);
  dbt stops at gold and does not touch it.

At a seam: state plainly what is deferred, what would unblock it, and STOP.
