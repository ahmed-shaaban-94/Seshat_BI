description: >-
  Run dbt as the build ENGINE for silver/gold ONLY behind the Mapping Ready gate,
  and record its run/test/parity output as DERIVED evidence -- never as an approval.
  Use when someone asks to build silver/gold for a mapped table with dbt, run dbt
  tests, or check dbt parity against the existing gold tables in the Seshat BI repo.
  dbt is the engine; Seshat BI is the brain. This skill READS the approved map,
  EXECUTES approved dbt steps behind the gate, and WRITES evidence; it never defines
  meaning, never moves a stage to pass, and HARD-STOPS at every human judgment call.

# dbt-transformation-adapter

- **Authority category (F024):** Execution Adapter / `DB-connected` (NOT publish-capable).
- **Roadmap feature:** F029  **On-disk spec:** `specs/023-dbt-transformation-adapter`.

dbt is the build ENGINE: it compiles SQL, materializes models, and runs tests. Seshat BI
is the brain: it owns the approved source-map, the metric contracts, and the readiness
spine, and routes every judgment call to a named human. This skill is how the agent runs
dbt without letting it become the brain. You (the agent reading this) ARE the runtime; this
skill is procedure, not an engine -- there is no daemon, no scheduler, no auto-approver.
See `docs/decisions/0009-dbt-is-transformation-adapter.md` and
`templates/dbt-adapter-contract.md`.

> ACTIVATED: feature 133 added the governed runtime under `dbt/`, the pinned
> `dbt-core==1.12.0` + `dbt-postgres==1.10.2` extra, and the `seshat dbt`
> command family. Use that wrapper only; raw dbt commands bypass the accepted-plan,
> selector, shadow-schema, redaction, lock, and evidence contracts.

## Scope boundary (read first)

Invoke-and-record only. This skill runs dbt behind the gate and records its findings as
evidence; it does NOT define source mapping, metric contracts, or semantic logic, does NOT
publish Power BI, and does NOT move a readiness stage to `pass`. Three non-negotiables:

- **The entry gate is the FIRST refusal point** (Principle IV). The canonical gate
  signal is `mappings/<table>/readiness-status.yaml` -> `stages.mapping_ready.status ==
  pass` WITH a matching `approvals[]` entry (RS1); its human-readable mirror
  `unresolved-questions.md` `Gate status: CLEARED` (zero open rows) MUST agree. dbt may
  run NO staging/silver/gold model unless that canonical signal holds -- a missing
  readiness-status file, `mapping_ready != pass`, or a mismatch between the two ->
  Refuse + record a `blocking_reason`. The presence of dbt model files is NOT
  permission to build.
- **A green `dbt test` is EVIDENCE, never an approval** (the governance hinge). Record the
  pass/fail counts as `evidence[]` / `blocking_reasons[]`; Tower readiness + a named human
  move Silver/Gold Ready to `pass`, citing that evidence + the approval. There is NO path
  by which a green run alone writes `pass`.
- **dbt stops at gold** (Principle III). dbt is `DB-connected`, not publish-capable;
  materializing/publishing a Power BI model is the parked F016 adapter, gated separately.

**ASCII only, UTF-8 no BOM** in everything you author (`--`, `->`; no em-dash / smart-quote
/ unicode-arrow).

## Run-state: read mappings/<table>/ FIRST (no new state file)

Compute what you may do from what is already on disk -- there is NO dbt orchestration state
file to create:

| What you observe | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| `mappings/<table>/readiness-status.yaml` missing, or `stages.mapping_ready.status` != `pass`, or its `approvals[]` entry is absent, or the `unresolved-questions.md` `Gate status: CLEARED` mirror does not agree | **REFUSE.** Record a `blocking_reason` ("Mapping Ready not pass"); run no model. |
| `stages.mapping_ready.status == pass` WITH a matching `approvals[]` entry, the `Gate status: CLEARED` mirror agrees, approved `source-map.yaml` present | **Permitted** to run staging/silver/gold models that CITE the approved map. |
| A dbt model builds a meaning (grain/PK/PII/placement) the map does NOT state | **DEFECT.** The model cites the map, it does not extend it; the map is re-approved first. |
| The table is already built by migrations | The dbt mart must pass the **reconciliation parity test** before it can become the build path. |

You may READ Mapping Ready; you may NOT write `pass` to any stage (that is the named human's
action). Read the approved map by path + git ref; every model must cite it.

## Fixed sequence (use the governed wrapper only)

| Step | What you do | Authority note |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 Prerequisites | Run `seshat dbt doctor --format json`. It queries no database. | Missing runtime/profile values -> `[PENDING LIVE PROFILE]`. |
| 2 Gate + citations | Run `seshat dbt validate --table <table> --format json`. | Refuses before planning unless Mapping Ready has the named-human approval and every selected model cites it. |
| 3 Immutable plan | Run `seshat dbt plan --table <table> --format json`; review the exact nodes, target, versions, mapping identity, and shadow schemas. | The returned digest accepts execution, not business meaning or readiness. |
| 4 Build | Run `seshat dbt build --table <table> --accept-plan <digest> --format json`. | Recomputes the plan before DB access; drift refuses execution. |
| 5 Test-only rerun | When needed, run `seshat dbt test --table <table> --accept-plan <digest> --format json`. | Evidence, never approval. |
| 6 Offline review | For an existing run directory, run `seshat dbt inspect-run --table <table> --artifacts <run-directory> --format json`. | Revalidates artifacts; it is not a second build. |
| 7 Recommend + STOP | Report normalized evidence and `blocking_reasons`, then stop for a named human. | Never self-approve or switch away from migrations. |

## The reconciliation parity test (four assertions, exact to the cent)

For a table already built by migrations, assert against the migration-built gold fact:

1. equal fact row count;
2. preserved distinct count of the fact's degenerate / business key;
3. each additive money-measure sum equal to the cent -- absolute delta `<= 0.01` per
   additive measure, matching the committed money scale (e.g. `NUMERIC(12,2)`);
4. equal per-dimension distinct member counts -- each conformed dimension's member count,
   including any unknown / sentinel member where the gold model defines one.

A mismatch -> record the measured delta as a `blocking_reason`, keep Gold Ready `blocked`,
keep migrations the default. After an approved switch, the migration files are RETAINED as
the parity oracle; the parity test RE-RUNS on EVERY dbt build while the oracle is retained
(never one-time-at-switch). The cent tolerance is the stated default -- NOT a score.

## HARD-STOP: the Principle V judgment calls (never auto-resolve)

STOP and escalate to a named human; record an owner row -- do not edit around any of these:

- a grain ambiguity, or a model that would change the declared grain (e.g. collapse line
  items) -- forbidden without a re-approved map.
- a sentinel-vs-null choice (e.g. an unknown-member handling that diverges from the
  migration's sentinel -- the parity test catches the divergence; resolving it is a human call).
- a PII publish-safety question on any column.
- a business rollup / segment mapping the map does not answer.
- moving Silver Ready / Gold Ready to `pass` -- always a named-human approval, never a
  green `dbt test`.
- a build-path switch (migrations -> dbt) -- only after parity passes AND a human approves;
  never flip the default on your own; never delete the migration oracle.
- any dbt-core / dbt-postgres major (and, until compatibility tests exist, minor) version
  bump -- a named reviewer approves; no automerge.

## Live and downstream seams (report and stop, never fake)

- **A live dbt run** -- needs the `dbt` extra, a DB, and `SESHAT_DBT_*` values
  in the gitignored `.env`; committed `profiles.example.yml` contains only
  `env_var()` references. Without them, report `[PENDING LIVE PROFILE]`, the
  enable steps, and no compile/build/test/parity success.
- **The Power BI build** -- F016 (parked, publish-capable, gated on Semantic Model Ready);
  dbt stops at gold and does not touch it.

At a seam: state plainly what is deferred, what would unblock it, and STOP.
