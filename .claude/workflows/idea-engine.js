PROJECT: Seshat BI (package alias Seshat_BI; formerly "Tower BI Agent Kit"). An AGENT-FIRST
Retail BI readiness system. It guides agents from raw retail sources through 7 readiness
stages — Source → Mapping → Silver → Gold → Semantic Model → Dashboard → Publish — using
documented gates, evidence, and human approvals. The agent is the interface; CLI gates
(retail check, retail validate) are helpers it calls, never the product.

HARD PRINCIPLES (any idea that violates these is INELIGIBLE):
- Reasoning/knowledge layers NEVER execute (no running queries/DAX/Python, no DB touch).
- DEFINE vs CHECK vs APPROVE are separate; agents never self-grant a human approval.
- Generic-only: C086 (pharmacy) is one worked EXAMPLE, never a universal schema.
- No fabricated confidence: readiness = status + evidence + blockers, never a made-up score.
- Secrets only in gitignored .env; gold-only metric binding; never bypass readiness gates.
- YAGNI: add the seam, not speculative implementation, unless asked.

WHAT EXISTS (grounding):
- 4 router-first knowledge layers under skills/: bi-sql-knowledge (table grain),
  bi-dax-knowledge (filter context), bi-python-knowledge (dataframe grain, seed),
  retail-kpi-knowledge (business KPI meaning, seed — newest, PR #58).
- Roadmap F005–F015 SHIPPED; F016 (Power BI Execution Adapter) is the ONLY unbuilt core
  feature (deferred, execution-only, gated on semantic-model readiness). Tier 5 companion
  modules/adapters (F024–F034) are PARTLY shipped.
- Docs spine: docs/readiness/ (the stage model), docs/knowledge-map.md (the router),
  COMPASS.md + AGENTS.md (entry contract), docs/metrics/ (F009 metric-contract store +
  retail-kpi-catalog menu), docs/quality/agent-routing-smoke-test.md.

OUTPUT IS AN IDEA BANK, NOT A ROADMAP. Nothing generated here is planned, scheduled, or
approved. Verdicts/scores are a triage opinion only. Ideas advance only through the normal
spec/feature process with a human decision.

duplicate a shipped feature? is the "feasible" framing hiding a missing dependency (a gold

executor or a stats engine? Default to skeptical: if an idea can't survive a hard look, say so.
