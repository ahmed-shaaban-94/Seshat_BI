# mappings/

Per-table **source-mapping artifacts** -- the committed inputs to the source-mapping gate
(constitution Principle IV: a source must be profiled and mapped into reviewed artifacts
**before** any `silver.*` SQL is written).

## Layout

One folder per source table, holding that table's five filled artifacts:

```
mappings/
`-- <table>/                      # table id, snake_case, short (Windows MAX_PATH)
    |-- source-profile.md         # Phase 1 profile (the numbers)
    |-- source-map.yaml           # the spine: grain/PK/columns/gold placement
    |-- assumptions.md            # ADR 0002 (RC1-RC16) adopted vs deviated
    |-- unresolved-questions.md   # build-blocking decisions (stop-and-ask)
    `-- reconciliation-report.md  # live-acceptance results (retail validate)
```

## How to use

1. Copy the five blanks from [`../templates/`](../templates/) into `mappings/<table>/`.
2. Fill them by running the playbook (`../docs/medallion-playbook.md`): profile -> map ->
   record assumptions/questions -> review gate -> build silver/gold -> reconcile.
3. The folder is reviewed as a unit at the Phase-4 review gate, before any `silver.*` SQL.
