# Docs Drift & Consistency Audit — 2026-06-28

A read-only sweep of the repository's documentation for **drift**: stale numeric
claims, cross-document contradictions, broken internal references, and skill↔doc
mismatches. This file records what was inspected, what was **fixed in the same
change**, what is **left open for a human decision**, and what was **deliberately
not touched** (point-in-time historical artifacts).

This is an evidence record, not a score. Every status below is a word
(`fixed` / `open` / `not-a-defect` / `false-alarm`), never a number — per hard
rule #9.

## Method

Four parallel read-only passes (one per drift axis), then **independent
re-verification of every headline claim against the source code** before any edit:

1. Numeric / status claims (rule counts, feature status, dates).
2. Cross-document contradictions (README / RELEASE_NOTES / roadmap / COMPASS / AGENTS).
3. Broken internal references (markdown links + backtick path mentions).
4. Skill definition (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) vs the matching doc.

## Ground truth established (verified against `src/`)

| Fact | Verified value | How verified |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Static `retail check` rule count | **33** | `@register(` count = 33; distinct ids = 33 |
| Distinct rule ids | `A1 B1 C1 C2 D1–D11 G1–G6 P1 P2 R1 S1–S8` | grep of `src/retail/rules/` |
| Rule **families** (letter prefixes) | **8** — S, D, C, R, G, P, **A**, **B** | distinct id prefixes |
| `A1` | "route-registry targets resolve or are honestly marked planned" | `src/retail/rules/routes.py` |
| `B1` | "no module-scope DB/network import in the static core (never-execute)" | `src/retail/rules/never_execute.py` |

> Two of the four automated passes mis-stated the count as **34** and the families
> as ambiguous. Independent verification corrects this to **33 / 8 families**.
> The lesson: the count is asserted as free text in many files, so it drifts —
> see the root-cause note at the end.

## Fixed in this change

| File | Was | Now | Why |
|------|-----|-----|-----|
| `docs/worked-examples/retail-store-sales.md` | "the 23-rule static gate" (line 17) | "the 33-rule static gate" | Self-contradicted line 182 of the same file, which already says 33 |
| `docs/architecture/tower-bi-agent-kit.md` | "(`src/retail/`, 31 static rules)" (line 51) | "33 static rules" | Inconsistent with the same doc's own "33 rules" at lines 85/167 |
| `docs/architecture/tower-bi-agent-kit.md` | `[ADR 0003](decisions/0003-…)` (line 125) | `[ADR 0003](../decisions/0003-…)` | Broken relative link — missing parent prefix |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | "the 6 rule families" (line 51) | "the 8 rule families" | A and B families (idea-bank rules) were added; 6 is stale |
| `docs/glossary.md` | family table listed 6 (S D C R G P) | added **A** (route registry) and **B** (never-execute) rows | The canonical family list was missing the two idea-bank families |
| `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-22-analytics-skeleton.md` | links `docs/conventions.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/` (lines 537–538) | `../../conventions.md`, `../specs/` | Absolute-style paths broke from the nested location |
| `docs/decisions/0012-p2-commit-types.md` | two references to `memory/p2-rule-no-commit-scopes.md` (lines 36, 76) | references removed; the decision context is already stated inline | Target file never existed (also flagged in the external-audit report) |

## Naming — RESOLVED by the owner (unify on "Seshat BI")

The "Retail Tower Analytics" label was a stale third name. The owner decided to
**unify on "Seshat BI"**, applied to **active/live surfaces only**, following the
naming policy already recorded in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-26-repo-rename-seshat-bi-preflight.md`:

**Unified in this change:**
- `CLAUDE.md` header → "Seshat BI".
- `.claude/agents/powerbi-analyst.md` (description + heading) → "Seshat BI".
- `.claude/skills/retail-govern/SKILL.md` brand strings ("Retail Tower governance
  checker" / "Retail Tower's conventions") → "Seshat BI".
- 12 active `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — the stale repo slug "Retail_Tower_analytics
  repo" → "Seshat BI repo".
- 3 active `.claude/workflows/*.js` — log/prompt token "Retail_Tower_analytics" →
  the current repo slug "Seshat_BI".

**Deliberately left unchanged (per the preflight policy):**
- **Historical archives** — dated `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs}/*`, `.superpowers/sdd/`,
  `specs/0xx` — point-in-time records (including the original "Retail Tower Analytics
  Skeleton" plan title and the Windows-path build steps).
- **The Python package / CLI `retail`** — permanent; "Seshat_BI" is only a brand alias.
- **`.specify/memory/constitution.md`** "Retail Tower **OS** orchestrator" — a
  reference to a *separate external* system this service is explicitly NOT bound to,
  not a brand string for this product.
- **`docs/architecture/tower-bi-agent-kit.md`** — already reconciled (its header states
  the rename and its Phase-0 body intentionally preserves the original name).
- **"Tower BI Agent Kit"** mentions — the documented prior internal name, kept where it
  explains the rebrand.

## Not a defect / deliberately not touched

- **`specs/**`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `templates/`, dated
  `docs/superpowers/specs|plans/*`, and ADR bodies** cite older counts
  (21/22/23/26/27/28/31). These are **point-in-time artifacts** describing the
  state when authored; rewriting them would be noisy and historically dishonest.
  *Exception worth a future look:* the constitution (`.specify/memory/`) is a
  living governing doc and still says "26 rule" / "23-rule" in places — refresh it
  via the `speckit-constitution` flow if/when convenient, not in this docs pass.
- **`README.md` does mention F034** (rows at lines 147 and 275) — an automated
  pass wrongly reported it as omitted. **False alarm.**
- **Docs that already say "33 rules"** (roadmap, `post-idea-bank-capability-state`,
  README line 139) are **correct** — not drift.
- **F016 "official Power BI MCP preferred, `pbi-cli` no longer preferred"** guidance
  is consistent in substance across skills and docs; only minor wording variance
  in `docs/readiness/dashboard-ready.md` ("no longer *the* preferred path"). Cosmetic.

## Discoverability observation (not a contradiction)

Only 4 skills have an operator guide under `docs/tools/`
(approval-console, evidence-pack-generator, readiness-viewer, pr-readiness-reviewer).
The other skills are documented in their own `SKILL.md` (and, for the adapters,
`docs/integrations/`), but a reader browsing `docs/tools/` will not find them.
Optional follow-up: have `docs/operations/agent-operating-playbook.md` index every
skill with its landing path. Left as a note, not done here.

## Root cause & fix — single source of truth (IMPLEMENTED)

The dominant drift was the **rule count repeated as free text in ~13+ files**, so
every new rule left a tail of stale numbers. This is now fixed at the root:

- **`docs/glossary.md` is the single source of truth for the count.** It carries
  the authoritative rule catalog plus one explicit count line ("Currently 33 rules
  in 8 families"), and a convention: when a rule changes, update the catalog and
  that line together, and **do not restate the number elsewhere**.
- **All live docs were de-numbered.** README, the roadmap, `readiness-pipeline.md`,
  `tower-bi-agent-kit.md`, both worked examples, and `post-idea-bank-capability-state.md`
  now refer to "the static `retail check` gate" by name (linking to the glossary)
  instead of hardcoding "N rules". Historical *deltas* (e.g. "A1 + B1 add two rules",
  ADR-0006's "27 → 28") are kept — they are fixed facts, not current-state counts.
- **Left as a number on purpose:** historical/dated artifacts (`specs/**`, the
  constitution, dated `superpowers/` docs) and the unrelated SQL-analyzer "SAR" rule
  family in `skills/bi-sql-knowledge/`.

**Optional follow-up (code, not done here):** add a `retail check --list` / `retail
rules` subcommand that prints ids + count from the registry, so the count becomes
machine-derived and even the glossary line can cite a command. The rule set is
already pinned by `tests/unit/test_rules_wiring.py` `EXPECTED_RULE_IDS`.
