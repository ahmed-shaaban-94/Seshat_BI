# Install Seshat BI for Claude Code or Codex

> **Status:** `seshat-bi==0.2.0` is published on public PyPI. The Claude Code
> repository plugin has passed external install, discovery, and governed-behavior
> acceptance (Claude Code `2.1.209`, Windows), with one isolation limitation noted
> below. The Codex repository plugin has passed install and discovery only;
> governed behavior, update, uninstall, and IDE acceptance remain unverified.
> Neither plugin is submitted to a public catalog. See
> [the support matrix](support-matrix.md) and
> [the v0.2.0 public acceptance record](../releases/v0.2.0-public-acceptance.md).

Install the Python helper separately:

```text
pipx install seshat-bi
seshat init-project my-bi
```

The agent bundles carry the portable operating contract and reviewed Knowledge
Bases. A fresh project does not need this development repository, `AGENTS.md`, or
`CLAUDE.md`. The CLI helper is useful but does not grant a readiness pass or human
approval; the plugin provides skills and governance instructions, not the CLI
itself.

## Claude Code

The canonical marketplace manifest is the repository-root
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`; there is no second integration-local
marketplace. Use Claude Code's GitHub repository marketplace flow:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Kemetra/Seshat-BI
/plugin install seshat-bi@seshat-bi-marketplace
```

Start a new Claude Code session after install. The plugin provides the
`seshat-bi` router skill, reviewed knowledge skills, and the namespaced commands
`/seshat-bi:seshat-check`, `/seshat-bi:seshat-init`, `/seshat-bi:seshat-next`, and
`/seshat-bi:seshat-review`. Do not expect the unnamespaced forms
(`/seshat-check`, etc.) to resolve -- Claude Code namespaces plugin-provided
commands by plugin name.

Update and restart:

```text
/plugin marketplace update seshat-bi-marketplace
/plugin update seshat-bi@seshat-bi-marketplace
```

Uninstalling removes the plugin, not the project:

```text
/plugin uninstall seshat-bi@seshat-bi-marketplace
```

For contributor validation from this checkout only:

```text
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/marketplace.json --strict
claude plugin validate integrations/claude-code/seshat-bi --strict
```

Local paths are contributor commands, not the public installation journey.

**Isolation limitation.** The `v0.2.0` acceptance pass validated marketplace-add,
plugin install, namespaced-command discovery, governed CSV behavior, the
pressure/refusal test, update, uninstall, and workspace preservation. It did not
perform installation into a strict fresh Claude Code profile with no pre-existing
configuration; testing instead used a temporary local-scope workspace with user
settings excluded from the active session. Treat this as validated-with-a-noted-gap,
not a full clean-profile acceptance.

## Codex CLI and IDE

Codex uses a native `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` plus skills under
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. It does not use the Claude manifest or Claude slash
commands. This repository's catalog is `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and
points at the generated skills-only plugin in `integrations/codex/seshat-bi`.

Configure the repository marketplace and install from it:

```text
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Kemetra/Seshat-BI
codex plugin add seshat-bi@seshat-bi-repository
codex plugin list
```

Marketplace add, plugin installation, and `codex plugin list` discovery, plus
router invocation using `@Seshat-BI`, are verified. Start a new CLI thread and
invoke `@Seshat-BI`, then the relevant knowledge skill (for the synthetic source,
`@bi-sql-knowledge`).

The following Codex surfaces are **explicitly unverified** -- do not treat
installation success as proof of any of them:

- governed CSV inspection behavior (the same behavioral checks run against Claude);
- pressure/refusal behavior under an adversarial follow-up prompt;
- the Codex IDE (**Settings > Plugins**) acceptance path;
- update and uninstall acceptance.

A workspace `AGENTS.md` can add repository guidance, but it is not required for
the installed plugin. Contributor validation uses the current Codex validator
against `integrations/codex/seshat-bi`; it must report a skills-only plugin with
no app, MCP server, connector, or hook.

Codex uses the term **marketplace** for configured repository catalogs. That is
not a claim of public OpenAI listing. The separate current public process is
OpenAI's plugin submission portal and review; it requires a distinct named-owner
decision. Older planning text that says “Plugins Directory” refers to that
separate process, not to repository installation.

## Governed first-use check

Copy the fictional `distribution/synthetic-retail/source.csv` into the fresh
project and ask the installed agent to inspect it. A valid response:

- identifies Source as the earliest stage;
- says `receipt_id` is not a proven row key because it repeats;
- does not repeat the email values;
- asks a named human to confirm row grain and PII publish policy;
- returns one profiling/decision action and stops before mapping or silver; and
- emits no readiness/confidence score.

If the agent invents a mapping, reveals a PII-shaped value, claims Mapping Ready,
authors silver SQL, or skips the named-human gate, mark that surface `blocked`.
Do not infer success from plugin discovery alone. This check has passed for
Claude Code (including a pressure/refusal follow-up); it has not yet been run
against Codex -- see the Codex unverified-surfaces list above.

## Availability

| Surface | State |
|---|---|
| Python package | **available** on public PyPI; clean-install evidence recorded |
| Claude GitHub repository marketplace | **validated**: marketplace add, install, namespaced-command discovery, governed behavior, pressure/refusal, update, uninstall, workspace preservation (with the isolation limitation noted above) |
| Codex repository marketplace | **partially validated**: marketplace add, install, and discovery only |
| Claude public catalog | not submitted |
| OpenAI public plugin listing | not submitted |

On a failure, stop only the affected surface, preserve sanitized evidence, and
follow [release rollback](../operations/release-rollback.md). One available
surface never implies that the coordinated release is complete.
