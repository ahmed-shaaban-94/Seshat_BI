# Demo: retail_store_sales

A guided reading path through the **second** worked example,
`retail_store_sales`. Follow it to see the readiness spine applied end to end on
a domain that is not C086.

## Why this demo exists

The C086 pharmacy example proves the pattern once. The risk with a single example
is that the kit silently hardcodes that example's schema. `retail_store_sales` is
a deliberately different domain -- a generic store-sales source (no returns, PII
kept, English-only) -- carried through the same gates with no special-casing.

## How it proves the kit is not hardcoded to C086

`retail_store_sales` uses the same artifacts, the same gates, and the same `retail`
surfaces as C086, but with its own grain, its own keys, and its own metric
contracts. Nothing in the spine is named after either example. If the kit only
worked for C086, the second example could not reach Dashboard Ready -- it does.

   -- the narrative walkthrough of the whole run.
2. [`mappings/retail_store_sales/source-profile.md`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/source-profile.md)
   -- what the source looked like before any mapping (Source Ready).
3. [`mappings/retail_store_sales/source-map.yaml`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/source-map.yaml)
   -- the reviewed map: grain, keys, PII, placement (the Mapping Ready gate).
4. [`mappings/retail_store_sales/assumptions.md`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/assumptions.md)
   and
   [`mappings/retail_store_sales/unresolved-questions.md`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/unresolved-questions.md)
   -- the recorded reasoning behind the map.
5. [`mappings/retail_store_sales/metrics/`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/metrics/)
   -- the five approved metric contracts (`TotalSales`, `TotalQuantity`,
   `TransactionCount`, `AvgTransactionValue`, `DiscountedTransactionRate`).
6. [`mappings/retail_store_sales/reconciliation-report.md`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/reconciliation-report.md)

   [`mappings/retail_store_sales/reconciliation-bronze-to-gold.md`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/reconciliation-bronze-to-gold.md)
   -- the validation/reconciliation evidence.
7. [`mappings/retail_store_sales/design/`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/design/)
   -- the dashboard layout, visual list, and visual-to-contract binding map
   (Dashboard Ready, designed from the approved contracts).
8. [`mappings/retail_store_sales/handoff/`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/handoff/)
   -- the BI handoff pack and its review checklist.
9. [`mappings/retail_store_sales/readiness-status.yaml`](../../mappings/retail_store_sales/readiness-status.yaml)
   -- the per-stage readiness state that ties it all together.

## What this demo proves

- **Source mapping before silver.** The reviewed `source-map.yaml` exists and the
  Mapping Ready gate is cleared before any silver build -- mapping is not skipped.
- **Metric contracts before dashboard.** The five contracts under `metrics/` are
  defined and approved before the dashboard design under `design/` -- every visual
  binds to a contract, none invents a KPI.
- **Validation before Power BI.** Reconciliation/validation evidence is recorded
  before any handoff toward Power BI -- gold is not handed off unvalidated.
- **Publish Ready can honestly remain `warning`.** In
  `readiness-status.yaml`, stages 1-6 are `pass` while `publish_ready` is
  `warning` (a prior publish approval was retracted as stale after a metric
  correction, and live publish is the deferred F016 adapter). The kit records the
  honest state rather than forcing a green Publish Ready.
