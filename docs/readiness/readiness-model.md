# Tower BI Readiness System -- the model

- **Status:** Planning (docs/templates; no runtime code).
- **What it is:** the **operating spine** inside the Tower BI Agent Kit. It does
  NOT replace the constitution, the medallion playbook, the source-mapping gate,
  or `retail check` -- it **organizes them into stage-based readiness state** the
  agent reads to decide the next allowed action.

## Why a readiness spine

The kit already has the gates (mapping gate, `retail check`, `retail validate`).
What it lacks is a single, legible answer to "where is this table, and what is
the one next thing allowed?" The readiness spine is that answer -- a **state
model**, not a new gate. It turns the existing gates into a tracked sequence.

## The state model

Each source/table/report carries a **readiness status** (see
`templates/readiness-status.yaml`) with one record per stage. A stage status is
one of four values -- never a fabricated number:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `not_started` | the stage has not begun; prior stage may not be `pass` yet |
| `blocked` | a required artifact, check, or approval is missing -- see `blocking_reasons` |
| `warning` | advanced but with a non-fatal issue recorded (a static WARN, an accepted deviation) |
| `pass` | all required artifacts exist, all required checks pass, approvals are recorded |

A stage may be entered only when the **prior stage is `pass`** (see
`readiness-pipeline.md`). `warning` does not block the next stage by itself; a
`blocked` does.

## No fake confidence (the scoring rule)

Readiness is **explicit status + evidence + blockers**, not a confidence score.

- `evidence[]` lists the committed artifacts/check-runs that justify a `pass`.
- `blocking_reasons[]` lists the concrete reasons a stage is `blocked`.
- A `pass` with no evidence is a defect.
- **Numeric scores are OPTIONAL and DEFERRED.** If a `score` field is used it
  MUST be marked optional and MUST cite the evidence it derives from. Scoring
  rules are not defined yet; until they are, do not emit a number that reads as
  confidence. Prefer the four explicit statuses.

## What every stage doc defines

Each `docs/readiness/<stage>-ready.md` defines, in this shape:

- **Purpose** -- what "ready" means at this stage.
- **Required artifacts** -- the committed files that must exist.
- **Required checks** -- the gate(s) that must pass (`retail check`,
  `retail validate`, an artifact review).
- **Statuses** -- what `not_started` / `blocked` / `warning` / `pass` mean here.
- **Blocking reasons** -- the concrete reasons this stage is `blocked`.
- **Required owner / approval** -- who must sign off, if anyone.
- **Next allowed action** -- the single next step when the stage passes.
- **What the agent must NOT do** -- the actions forbidden at this stage.

## One short example (readiness-status)

A minimal, generic instance (full schema in `templates/readiness-status.yaml`):

```yaml
table: <schema>.<table>          # generic; not a C086 value
source_family: <source_system>
current_stage: mapping_ready
stages:
  source_ready:   { status: pass,    evidence: ["mappings/<table>/source-profile.md"] }
  mapping_ready:  { status: blocked,  blocking_reasons: ["grain not confirmed unique on data"] }
  silver_ready:   { status: not_started }
  gold_ready:     { status: not_started }
  semantic_ready: { status: not_started }
  dashboard_ready:{ status: not_started }
  publish_ready:  { status: not_started }
approvals: []                    # e.g. {stage: mapping_ready, owner: analyst, at: <date>}
next_action: "resolve the open grain question in mappings/<table>/unresolved-questions.md"
last_checked_at: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
checked_by: "<agent | person>"
```

## What the agent does with the spine

- Reads the readiness status to find `current_stage` and `next_action`.
- Launches the workflow for that stage only -- never skips ahead.
- On a gate failure, records `blocked` + `blocking_reasons`, and STOPS.
- Never writes a `pass` it cannot back with `evidence`.
- Never fabricates a score.
