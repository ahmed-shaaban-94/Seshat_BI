"""Concrete Bronze source adapters (issues #404 / #405).

Two adapters satisfy the pluggable :class:`SourceAdapter` contract; the mode
(:mod:`seshat.dagster_adapter.source_mode`) chooses which one drives the ingest
head. Both delegate their DB work to the lazily-imported ``db`` boundary, so
the module imports without a driver.

* :class:`CsvLandingAdapter` -- the DEFAULT. A raw ``<table>.csv`` OWNS and
  (re)creates ``bronze.<table>`` (``db.load_csv``: drop-and-reload). This is
  the one destructive-by-design mode; it is UNCHANGED from the pre-feature
  path (same measured ``{"rows_loaded": ...}``).

* :class:`ExistingBronzeAdapter` -- NON-DESTRUCTIVE DB-first. A pre-loaded
  ``bronze.<table>`` is verified READ-ONLY (``db.inspect_bronze``: only
  ``information_schema`` + ``SELECT count(*)``). It issues ZERO Bronze DDL/DML,
  returns ``mutated_bronze=False``, and halts fail-closed with a named blocker
  when the relation is absent, empty, or missing a column the approved
  source-map references.

An adapter that cannot proceed HALTS through the caller-supplied ``halt``
seam (records a blocking outcome, raises ``dagster.Failure``) -- it never
returns a fabricated success. Every DSN-touching path honors the deferred
boundary exactly as the pre-feature ``bronze_table`` did.
