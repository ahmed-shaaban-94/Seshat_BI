"""#404/#405: non-destructive existing-Bronze source mode (in-process).

The load-bearing proof: with SESHAT_DAGSTER_SOURCE_MODE=existing-bronze the
ingest head verifies a pre-loaded ``bronze.<table>`` READ-ONLY. It issues ZERO
Bronze DDL/DML (``load_csv`` never runs), ``raw_source_file`` records
``deferred`` (not a STOP edge), the gated tail proceeds, and a mismatched /
absent / empty relation fails closed with a named blocker.

Mirrors ``test_migrations_unchanged.py``: destructive ``db`` helpers are
monkeypatched to append to a list; the test asserts that list stays ``[]``.
