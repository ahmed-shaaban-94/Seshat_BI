"""US2/SC-003: the per-table build engine resolves fail-closed to migrations.

The engine flag lives in the human-reviewed committed working set
(mappings/<table>/build-engine.yaml, FR-001/plan-review R1); only the exact
value ``dbt`` engages the dbt engine. Absent file, malformed YAML, non-mapping,
absent layer key, or any other value -> ``migrations``. No exception may leak a
path or secret. The resolver is imported through the orchestration re-export so
the SAME tested implementation the doctor uses is exercised here.
