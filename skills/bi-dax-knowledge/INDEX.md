# INDEX -- route a DAX task to the right file(s)

## Route by task

| I need to... | Open only these | End on |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Ground a model before DAX** | `references/retail-schema.md`, `knowledge/dax-core-concepts.md` | mapped model roles / known missing model metadata |
| **2. Define a metric contract** | `patterns/metric-contract-patterns.json`, `knowledge/dax-core-concepts.md` | metric contract with grain, additivity, required fields, filter behavior, validation notes |
| **3. Write a basic measure** | `patterns/metric-contract-patterns.json`, `patterns/dax-patterns.json`, `knowledge/dax-best-practices.md` | generated measure + contract assumptions |
| **4. Write time intelligence** | `patterns/dax-patterns.json`, `knowledge/dax-core-concepts.md`, `knowledge/dax-retail-examples.md` | measure shape + date-table/model prerequisites |
| **5. Write ranking / segmentation / ABC** | `patterns/dax-patterns.json`, `knowledge/dax-retail-examples.md` | generated DAX shape + required model assumptions |
| **6. Review existing DAX** | `patterns/analyzer-rules.json`, `knowledge/dax-best-practices.md`, `knowledge/dax-anti-patterns.md` | analyzer-style verdict with issues, severity, fix direction |
| **7. Fix context/filter problems** | `knowledge/dax-evaluation-context-deep-dive.md`, `knowledge/dax-calculate-deep-dive.md`, `knowledge/dax-core-concepts.md` | diagnosis of context issue + corrected DAX shape or blocked metadata request |
| **8. Check semantic model prerequisites** | `patterns/metric-contract-patterns.json`, `knowledge/dax-core-concepts.md` | model-review checklist / missing prerequisites |
| **9. Tune DAX performance** | `knowledge/dax-engine-internals.md`, `knowledge/dax-performance-diagnostics.md`, `knowledge/dax-performance-notes.md` | performance diagnosis + safer rewrite direction |
| **10. Explain a DAX concept** | `knowledge/dax-core-concepts.md`, relevant deep dive if needed | concise explanation tied to user's model/problem |
| **11. Use analyzer rules** | `patterns/analyzer-rules.json`, `patterns/analyzer-rule-candidates.json` | rule-based review or staged candidate note |
| **12. Use retail examples** | `knowledge/dax-retail-examples.md`, `references/retail-schema.md` | adapted pattern mapped to the user's model, not copied blindly |

## Route by symptom

| Symptom | Likely route |
|---|---|
| Measure ignores slicers | Fix context/filter problems (row 7) |
| Total row looks wrong | Fix context/filter problems (row 7) |
| YOY/YTD wrong | Write time intelligence (row 4) |
| Ranking changes unexpectedly | Write ranking / segmentation / ABC (row 5) |
| DISTINCTCOUNT too high/low | Ground a model before DAX (row 1) + review existing DAX (row 6) |
| Measure slow | Tune DAX performance (row 9) |
| Visual KPI requested but no metric definition exists | Define a metric contract (row 2) |
| Date intelligence requested but no date table confirmed | Check semantic model prerequisites (row 8) |

## DAX stop rules

- Do not write a DAX measure before metric intent, grain, and filter behavior
  are known.
- Do not assume column names; map the user's model first.
- Do not design a dashboard KPI without a metric contract.
- Do not optimize before correctness.
- Do not fake semantic model prerequisites such as date table, relationships,
  uniqueness, or grain.
- If required model metadata is missing, stop and ask for it or return a blocked
  verdict.
- Generated DAX must be traceable to a metric contract or explicit user intent.
