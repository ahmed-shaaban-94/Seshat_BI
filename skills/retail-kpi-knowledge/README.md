# Retail KPI Knowledge

This is an **initial seed** of a retail KPI / metric-contract knowledge layer for BI
agents. It makes retail KPIs contract-first and governed before any implementation work.

What it is not:

- It is **not** a full KPI encyclopedia. Only 10 metric contracts are seeded live.
- It is **not** DAX. No measures are implemented here.
- It is **not** SQL transformation or Python prep.
- It is **not** dashboard design.
- It does **not** grant readiness or pass/block status.

Why it exists: to force every retail KPI to have an agreed business definition, grain,
additivity call, required-field list, and ambiguity review *before* a measure or a
dashboard tile is built. This prevents duplicated DAX, ambiguous tiles, and KPIs that
silently mean different things in different reports.

## Current seed coverage

Live (seeded) metric contracts:

1. Gross Sales — `contracts/gross-sales.md`
2. Net Sales — `contracts/net-sales.md`
3. Quantity Sold — `contracts/quantity-sold.md`
4. Transactions Count — `contracts/transactions-count.md`
5. Average Transaction Value — `contracts/average-transaction-value.md`
6. Discount Amount — `contracts/discount-amount.md`
7. Discount Rate % — `contracts/discount-rate.md`
8. Returns Rate % (Value) — `contracts/returns-rate-value.md`
9. Gross Margin — `contracts/gross-margin.md`
10. Gross Margin % — `contracts/gross-margin-percent.md`

Also seeded: router/shell files, five knowledge concept files, eleven domain
overviews, seven KPI packs, three review checklists, five reference files, and three
pattern JSON files.

## Planned / deferred coverage

Named in routes, domains, packs, and `patterns/metric-contract-candidates.json` but
**not** yet given live contracts in this seed:

- Net Sales Growth %, Same-Store Sales Growth %, Sales per Square Meter
- Promotion Uplift %, Returns Rate % (Units)
- Average Basket Size (Units), Net Sales per Branch, Net Sales by Product
- Sell-Through Rate %, Inventory Turnover, Out-of-Stock Rate %, GMROI
- Net Sales vs Target %, YTD Net Sales
- Missing Key Dimensions Rate %, Late Data Arrival Count
- Customer domain KPIs (e.g., Customer Retention Rate %)

Deferred items are tracked honestly: routes pointing to them return a planned/deferred
note rather than a fabricated contract.
