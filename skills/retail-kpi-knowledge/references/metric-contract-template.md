# Metric Contract Template

Copy this blank to start a new contract in `contracts/`. Fill every section. Run the
metric-contract-review-checklist before handoff. Keep formulas in **business terms** — no
DAX, SQL, or Python code.

# [KPI name] — Metric Contract

ID: KPI-MC-XX

**Business question**
[The single business question this KPI answers.]

**Business definition**

which policies apply.]

**Required fields**
[Each field marked confirmed / assumption / derived. Do not assert unconfirmed fields
exist.]

[Cancelled/void/test, returns handling, VAT, internal transfers, zero-value, etc.]

[How to read it; healthy ranges; cautions.]

**Common mistakes**
[Summing non-additives, mixing gross/net, ignoring returns, wrong grain, name vs key, …]

**Validation checks**
[Reconciliation to source, sample spot-checks, bound checks, empty-period behaviour.]
