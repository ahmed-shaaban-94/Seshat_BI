# AGENTS.md -- operating rules for agents in this repo

Seshat BI is **agent-first**: you (the agent) are the interface; the CLI
gates (`retail check`, `retail validate`) are helpers you CALL, never the product.
This file is the short operating contract. The full law is
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`; the spine is `docs/readiness/readiness-model.md`.

> **Naming.** The product is **Seshat BI** (package alias `Seshat_BI`). It was
> previously developed under the internal name *Tower BI Agent Kit*; the
> governance spine is still the **Readiness System**. Same product, one brand.

## Decide from readiness state

- Read the table's **readiness status** (`templates/readiness-status.yaml` shape)
  to find `current_stage` and `next_action`. Launch the workflow for THAT stage
  only -- never skip ahead.
- The seven stages, in order: Source -> Mapping -> Silver -> Gold -> Semantic
  Model -> Dashboard -> Publish. A stage is entered only when the prior is `pass`.
- The `retail-orchestrate` conductor sequences the verbs; the readiness status
  records the state. Recompute `current_stage` from committed artifacts +
  `Gate status` + migration presence -- there is no separate run-state engine.

## Hard stops (never cross these)

- **Do NOT proceed to silver when `mapping_ready` is `blocked`** (or `Gate status`
  is not `CLEARED`). No `silver.*` SQL before an approved map (Principle IV).
- **Do NOT point Power BI at gold before `retail validate` passes** (Principle VIII).
- **Do NOT design dashboards before metric contracts exist** (roadmap rule 5).
- **Do NOT run the Power BI execution adapter** (the official Power BI MCP /
  connection; `pbi-cli` no longer the preferred path) -- that is feature 016, last
  and gated on `semantic_model_ready` (Principle II). It is a later, EXECUTION-ONLY
  adapter (it cannot define metrics, mappings, semantic logic, or dashboard design);
  no current stage depends on it.
- **Do NOT self-grant an approval.** Approvals are named human actions
  (Principle V): grain, PII publish-safety, business rollups, sentinel-vs-null.

## Report blockers explicitly

- A `blocked` stage MUST carry `blocking_reasons` -- a concrete fact, not "needs
  work". Record it in the status + `blocking-reasons.md`; then STOP.
- Readiness is `status + evidence + blockers`, NEVER a fabricated confidence
  number. A `pass` MUST cite `evidence`. Do not emit a score (scoring is deferred).
- `retail check` exit 0 is NECESSARY, not SUFFICIENT -- semantic correctness is
  proven only by the live `retail validate`. Do not let green read as "correct".

## Live DB steps -- graceful deferred mode

- The live boundary (`retail validate`, profiling against a DSN) needs the `db`
  extra + a DSN. If absent: report the boundary + the enable steps
  (`pip install 'retail[db]'`, set `DATABASE_URL` or `ANALYTICS_DB_*` in the
  gitignored `.env`), mark numbers `[PENDING LIVE PROFILE]`, and STAY USEFUL
  (author artifact structure). NEVER traceback, NEVER fake a pass.
- Secrets only in the gitignored `.env`. NEVER commit a real host/DSN. Power BI
  params use the `<placeholder>` form -- `G6` + `C2` block a real host at the gate.
  (Power BI Desktop re-writes the real host into `expressions.tmdl` on save;
  revert `powerbi/` before committing.)

## C086 is an example, never a schema

- C086 is the first worked example / a filled instance -- evidence the gate works.
  NEVER treat it as a universal schema. Generic templates carry no pharmacy
  specifics (billing codes, segment rollups, insurance PII). The questions and
  gates generalize; the answers are per-table (Principle VII).

## The verbs you compose

`retail-orchestrate` (conductor) -> `source-mapping` (the gate) ->
`retail-build-warehouse` (authors silver/gold SQL, stops before executing) ->
`retail-validate` (live checks) -> `retail-govern` (static check) ;
`pbip-workflow` (PBIP git/TMDL). Each verb does its job and STOPS; the self-heal
loop lives only in the conductor.
